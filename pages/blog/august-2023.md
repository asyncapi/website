As August comes to a close, many of us have had a slow month. Most of the community took some well-deserved time off, and the project has been quiet these past few weeks. We're looking forward to September and can't wait for everything to get back in full swing.

## AACoT'23 London
Speakers for AACoT'23 London Edition have been selected and informed; we are currently working on the schedule for the day. We anticipate a jam-packed day of inspiring talks and networking with esteemed industry experts. If you know any communities in London or ways we can maximize the AACoT'23 London event happening on the 20th of September, please do reach out to [Thulie](https://asyncapi.slack.com/team/U03CNJPMT7C) or [Lukasz](https://asyncapi.slack.com/team/UD698Q5LM) via Slack.

## AsyncAPI Bounty Program Trial
We're thrilled to share that the [AsyncAPI Bounty Program Trial](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/541) has been completed. We started the trial with a total of 7 projects consisting of coding, design, and technical writing tasks, categorized into medium and advanced levels. We had pre-set rules for the bounty trial, and everything went smoothly when it came to task assignment and completion. We also learned valuable insights during the trial, such as timeline extension and handling additional tasks necessary for task completion that will be implemented in the official program. Here are the accomplished tasks and the exceptional assignees:

## Google Summer of Code(GSoC)
Google Summer of Code'23 is coming to an end soon, and our esteemed mentors are currently underway with the final evaluation of the projects. We are excited and can't wait to announce the successful completion of the projects. One of the GSOC'23 mentees, [Richa Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richa14/), wrote a detailed blog, [Reflections on My GSoC 2023 Journey](https://14richa.github.io/2023-08-25/reflection-gsoc); please be sure to read it.

## Code of Conduct
We are calling for votes to establish our first Code of Conduct Committee that will enforce and ensure every community member follows and doesn't violate it. Please make sure to drop a comment with your nominations to the [AsyncAPI Code of Conduct Refresh discussion](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/682).
