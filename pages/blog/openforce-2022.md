Two years ago AsyncAPI Initiative actively participated in Hacktoberfest to help folks start their journey in open source. This was a very successful event. We got feedback that the level of commitment that we presented makes us perfect candidates for Google Summer of Code. 

Last year we participated in Google Summer of Code and again in Hacktoberfest. It went great! We onboarded many new super enthusiastic contributors that stayed with us longer. 

This year could not be different. We want to do it again and yet again on a larger scale. Thus active participation in initiatives focused on introducing new folks in open source became [one of our main goals for 2022](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/discussions/193).

Thanks to one of our contributors, [Hargun Kaur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hkaur008/) we learned about [OpenForce](https://www.openforce.tech/) and decided to join it in March 2022.

## What we offer

AsyncAPI maintainers prepared some GitHub issues that are easy enough to be completed in one month. We offer full support in discussing possible solutions and on-time review in pull requests.

AsyncAPI community is a safe place for your first open-source contribution. Many folks are open to support your first steps in this great world.

In exchange, every person that completes these tasks will get an AsyncAPI t-shirt!
