We already know that the present list of tools used inside AsyncAPI is presented on [AsyncAPI Tools Overview](/docs/tools) and it is manually maintained inside the Github repository. All the tools are sorted according to the different categories in which they are used and maintained by the contributors. But we don't have, how to filter the tools according to our interest ðŸ¤”, like languages, technolgies used in it, open source tools, etc. Also, what if you want to add your tool in the list, what you will do ðŸ¤”? Will make a PR?

What if I say, you don't need to make a mess of PR now ðŸ˜‰. Yepp, we introduce you with something new to add tools in our website. For this, stay tuned in the blog ðŸ‘‡.

# AsyncAPI Tool File

We have introduced a new concept of `.asyncapi-tool` file which describes the type and details of a tool related to AsyncAPI. This file will follow certain schema and fields to describe your tool appropriately according to the needs of a user and it will then automatically being added to our website within a week. But the question comes, where this file will exist? inside AsyncAPI repositories? Definitely not!. Here comes the twist, this file will be created and maintained in your Tool's repository, and it won't ask for our approval. This file will follow certain schema which you have to follow to successfully and appropriately add your tool to our brand new [Tools Dashboard](/tools). The proper schema of the file is described [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/blob/master/scripts/tools/tools-schema.json). You can use the tools like [Online JSON Validator](https://www.liquid-technologies.com/online-json-schema-validator) to validate your JSON data for Tool against the schema given above. For more detailed explanation, you can refer to our [official documentation](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/new-tool-documentation.md) of `.asyncapi-tool` file. 

## Tool File Structure

Here's the sample `.asyncapi-tool` file structure, which can be used to structurise your tool configuration.

```JSON
{
  "title": "ZenWave Code Generator",
  "description": "DDD and API-First for Event-Driven Microservices",
  "links": {
    "websiteUrl": "https://zenwave360.github.io/",
    "docsUrl": "https://zenwave360.github.io/zenwave-code-generator/plugins/asyncapi-spring-cloud-streams3/",
    "repoUrl": "https://github.com/zenwave360/zenwave-code-generator"
  },
  "filters": {
    "language": "Java",
    "technology": [
      "Maven",
      "Spring Cloud Streams"
    ],
    "categories": [
      "code-generator",
      "dsl",
      "mocking-and-testing",
      "cli"
    ],
    "hasCommercial": false
  }
}
```

## Summary

This project is under my Mentorship program 2022 and was mentored by [Lukasz Gornicki](https://github.com/derberg) and [Maciej UrbaÅ„czyk](https://github.com/magicmatatjahu). It was an amazing experience to work in this project and create such an automation for AsyncAPI tools. Quite a good learning experience as I researched about GitHub APIs, JSON Schema, GitHub Actions and lot more stuff. Moreover, I became the maintainer of AsyncAPI website repository and started contributing to organization in lot many ways. My work in the project consists of following Pull Requests: 

- [feat: tools backend implementation](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/pull/939)
- [feat: added new /tools page](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/pull/940)
- [feat: manual tools added to the Tools Dashboard](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/pull/1191)

You are welcomed to review my work in the program and I will love to get your feedbacks on this. You can contact me via [mail](mailto:akshatnema.official@gmail.com) or using DMs in [AsyncAPI Slack](https://asyncapi.com/slack-invite). Thanks to AsyncAPI and their community members for proividing me with this opportunity and I'll be looking for more such activities to contribute to the organization. Also, we are close to announce the next AsyncAPI Mentorship Program in year 2023 so stay tuned with us on [Slack](https://asyncapi.com/slack-invite).
