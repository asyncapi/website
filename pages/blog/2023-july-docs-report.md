# AsyncAPI Docs Report - July 2023

## Overview
In July 2023, our AsyncAPI documentation continued to flourish, with a total of **7,443 sessions** and **3,895 unique users** recorded. Engagement this month also included **2,345 new users**, further underlining the thriving growth of our docs community.

With the successful continuation of the _2023 Google Season of Docs_ and the _Technical Writing Mentorship Program_, our documentation contributors have made significant strides in understanding the intricacies of the new Spec 3 and its enhanced features.

## 2023 Google Season of Docs
During July, remarkable progress was achieved on [documenting the AsyncAPI document structure](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/issues/1507). Assigned to our diligent Google Season of Docs (GSoD) writers, most sections have already undergone their second draft, and these dedicated writers are actively engaging with core spec contributors to clarify any queries.

Simultaneously, the [create 100-level interactive learning path](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/issues/1520) has been advancing steadily. The [setup of a dedicated AsyncAPI GitHub repository to host with Killercoda](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/issues/1522), marks a significant step towards hosting our interactive learning paths. To ensure inclusivity, the topics to be covered in our 100-level learning path will also be determined through a forthcoming community vote.

## 2023 AsyncAPI Mentorship Program ‚Äî `Technical Writing` 
Technical writers participating in the 2023 AsyncAPI Mentorship Program are actively engaged in community building, opening a [community vote that successfully identified Kafka and Websocket as the prioritized protocols for this year's scope of work](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/815). 

Diving into detailed research and interactions with diverse community members, our [writers are also researching meticulously the most common AsyncAPI processes/tasks associated with Kafka and Websocket](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/814).

## Join `OPEN` Spec 3.0 Docs Meetings
Calling out to all members of the AsyncAPI community! Our efforts to bolster **Spec 3.0 documentation** continues with a series of community meetings. These biweekly gatherings, scheduled for Thursdays at 14:30 UTC, provide an open forum for enthusiastic contributors and inquisitive minds.
