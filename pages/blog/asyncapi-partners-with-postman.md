I'm proud and honored to let you know that we're partnering with [Postman](https://www.postman.com) to boost the development of Asynchronous APIs to a new level :rocket:

Since the very beginning, I knew the duty we had at hand was challenging. And still is! The specification was just the trigger of a snowball effect. What's the spec for if you can't do anything with it? Tooling is as important as the specification. However, tooling is a number of times more complex than the specification. We engineers don't want to abandon our favorite programming language and framework, therefore, it's AsyncAPI's responsibility to integrate with the existing tools in the market. **The specification (and tools) should work for the user, not the other way around.** Partnering with Postman allows us to boost the development of more and better tools to help engineers create and maintain Asynchronous APIs while using their favorite programming languages and frameworks.

**Our goal is to make Asynchronous APIs as successful and mature as REST APIs.** We are aware this is a long journey but, with Postman's help, we'll be able to grow the team and continue working on the AsyncAPI specification and all the necessary tools to create a delightful developer experience. The AsyncAPI Initiative team is fully committed to open source software (OSS), and the partnership with Postman will help us keep doing our job with freedom and independence.

## Next steps

We want to make the AsyncAPI Initiative a neutral and independent place for collaborating on defining the future of Asynchronous APIs. Next step for us is to host the project in a neutral foundation to guarantee the long-term success of the initiative. We're currently in conversations with different actors of the OSS world to make sure the initiative remains independent.

Also, we want you to work with us. [We are hiring](/jobs) at Postman to work full-time on AsyncAPI. In the first half of 2021, we'll open a bunch of positions, including Software Engineers, Graphic Designers, Technical Writers, and more. Make sure you don't miss them!

Before I finish, I would love to thank [Kin Lane](https://twitter.com/kinlane/) and [Abhinav Asthana](https://twitter.com/a85) for being so supportive. And of course, a huge shout out to [≈Åukasz Gornicki](https://twitter.com/derberq) and [Eva Morcillo](https://twitter.com/e_morcillo) for their tireless support. None of these would be possible without their help.

There's a bright future ahead for Asynchronous APIs. 2021 will be the year of AsyncAPI, the year of you, our beloved open-source community.

Cheers! :beers:
