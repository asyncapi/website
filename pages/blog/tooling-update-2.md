Another update on what happen in our tools that help developers develop EDAs and APIs! :fire: 

Last [tooling update can be found here](/blog/tooling-update-1). If you have any remarks or if something is missing, you can [suggest changes in through the website repository](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/tree/master/pages/blog/tooling-update-2.md). 

If you want to include updates from your personal tooling, the [next blog post can be found here](), just leave a comment with the updates you want included.

## In focus
[In January I opened up a discussion around potential changes](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/discussions/237) to the AsyncAPI roadmap to change the focus towards the entire lifecycle of APIs instead of only tooling to create APIs. Please do have a look and let us know what you think, as I will start to drive this change soon!

This means these tooling update blogs, will focus on the roadmap and goals to push them forward.
