excerpt: It is official! October is an AsyncAPI Hacking Fest! and November 16-18 a 2nd online AsyncAPI Conference
---

AsyncAPI Community organizes two important events in the second half of 2021:

- Hackathon in October
- Online conference on November 16-18

We do not have the website ready yet. 

We do not have the call for proposals opened yet. 

Don't worry though, all logistics are in progress.

## What we do know so far

We do know these events will take place for sure!

- Hackathon will be month-long, and there will be a prize for winners. Its goal is to provide [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) solutions that can help AsyncAPI Community in different ways:
  - Ease education and getting started with the project
  - Bring new AsyncAPI-related solutions to challenges the community has with event-driven architectures.
  - Extend existing tools, reuse them in some scenarios, add the extra implementation on top
- Conference will be 3 days long. The first day we will have a contributors summit where:
  - Current maintainers can showcase projects that they maintain and explain how to contribute
  - Google Summer of Code participants will be invited to showcase their projects
  - We will explain in detail how to become a contributor
- Day 2 and 3 of the conference setup highly depends on the number of proposals, source (vendors, tooling providers, or end-users), and topics.

## What you can do already

- Join detailed [discussion](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/discussions/categories/asyncapi-hack-conf-2021-organization) about the event!
- Start talking to your employer. **We need some cash from sponsors** to give it away to the community and spend some on event marketing.
- Start working on a proposal for a conference talk. The call for proposals is not yet officially opened, but you can already draft the initial proposal.
- Start brainstorming on your hackathon project as it's only one month left for the event:
  - You want to be part of it? Feel free to [discuss your idea with others](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/discussions/categories/asyncapi-hack-2021-ideas-brainstorming) if you are not sure it makes sense, 
  - You don't have time? That is fine, at least [drop your ideas](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/discussions/categories/asyncapi-hack-2021-ideas-brainstorming), maybe others will pick them up

That's all for now folks. Stay tuned!
