It's almost unbelievable that we are in 2024. And if you are reading this, Happy New Year to you and your loved ones. Continuing the tradition, we look at how the community has grown over the last 365 days and look forward to our next phase.

If you are curious about our past achievements, [please read the previous summary](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/2022-summary).

## Community Metrics
What better way to reflect on the past year than with numbers? This is the most significant way to gauge our growth and measure our visible impact as an open-source community.

### Slack
As of 2024, we are currently sitting at an overall total of **4,471** members in the AsyncAPI workspace. This is where all our community activities happen, from communication to sharing updates and helping contributors and new adopters for the AsyncAPI spec and tools. 

In 2023, we had 1488 people joining our workspace:

Below are our top 5 members who joined the community in 2023 and have been the most active among other newcomers. As a community, we are proud of their contributions as part of our Mentorship programs and even keeping us entertained with memes üòÄ.

/>


Additionally, our weekly activity continues to grow as we run different mentorship programs and initiatives that bring traction to our community.

### Social Media 

Social media is a medium we use for sharing news and updates around our community. We don't use it for marketing purposes but mainly for communication.


> And honestly, I didn't invest much when it came to socials, so don't expect big big numbers üòù

Let's dive into the data:

#### LinkedIn

For our LinkedIn page, we are currently sitting at **2988** overall followers, and during 2023, we gained a total of **849** followers since 2022.

<Figure

/>

We also don't use any premium or marketing services; everything you see here is 100% organic, and even though LinkedIn still has much to offer users, it is way better than the X/Twitter app, in my opinion.

/>

#### X/Twitter

I don't have much to say regarding Twitter, but on the bright side, we gained almost 1K followers since 2022, and we currently have 4.4k overall followers. When it comes to website referrals via Twitter, we have seen a decline compared to last year, 2022

<Figure
  src="/img/posts/2023-summary/referred-by-Twitter.webp"
/> 

Although the decline is shallow, I'm not extremely worried. Most top tweets for this year were appreciation tweets balanced up with technical tweets. Additionally, we don't use any paid services, and having any additional investment in this platform is not worth it, at least for now.

#### YouTube

The AsyncAPI YouTube channel performed way better than expected, especially as we moved from online to in-person conferences. We currently have over 364 people subscribed to our channel, increasing total subscribers to over 1,46k. Our live streams and conference recordings bring in a lot of views, and I'm optimistic about 2024 as well.

#### Newsletter
On the 5th of April, 2023, we sent out our first AsyncAPI Community Updates Newsletter. The main aim was to summarize monthly activities and initiatives in the community straight to your inbox.
Over the past nine months, the December Edition was the most popular. This was due to the release of the AsyncAPI v3, which was one of our major accomplishments in 2023.

And, of course, I'm not exempt from unsubscribers. Although the number might seem minimal to some, it still stings as a writer.

Looking forward to sending the 2024 Editions!!üéâüéâ

### Google Analytics

The pageviews on the AsyncAPI website increased significantly over the past year. Our major contributor to these metrics comes from docs, and we expect to see more in the coming year as people want to know more about the AsyncAPI v3.

<Figure
  src="/img/posts/2023-summary/google-analytics.webp"
/> 

We also lost 21 days' worth of data during October due to a PR update that affected the analytics workflow, but we are doing well.

### Google Search Console

Google Search Console is one of my favorite tools as it shows how much impact and interest we are gaining. Compared to 2022, we can see a surge in impressions and, slowly but surely, in clicks as well.

### Github

The number of contributors in the community keeps growing, from having over **1600** contributors in 2022 to **2320** contributors in 2023. 

<Figure
  src="/img/posts/2023-summary/Total-Contributors.webp"
/> 

Although we have a handful of maintainers, we try our best to manage, resolve, and close issues as much as we can. Additionally, we are focusing on growing the number of maintainers in the coming years.

### NPM

Numbers don't lie, and yes, these are the total downloads of the top AsyncAPI packages hosted in the Node Package Manager. We can also see the adoption of AsyncAPI spec downloads increased from 5M to 17M since 2022.

So, if you are worried about the project slowing down anytime soon, we are still growing strong.
