## Test sub-section 1

**Authors**

Before submitting your blog post, don't forget to change the `authors` array field to include yourself :smile:

## Test sub-section 2

**Images**

Please make sure to give credit to source of the image, for example:

> Cover image by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/silviarita-3142410/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=2634391">silviarita</a> from <a href="https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=2634391">Pixabay</a>

Add a cover image, you can change it on the metadata field above called `cover`. In case you need some inspiration we recommend https://unsplash.com/.
All images should be stored in the `public/img/posts/` folder, below is an example of using an image in your post with a caption (used as `alt` attribute):

<Figure
  src="/img/posts/2020-summary/linkedin-folowers.webp"
  caption="Figure 3: Followers growth in 2020"
/>

`<Figure src="/img/posts/2020-summary/linkedin-folowers.webp" caption="Figure 3: Followers growth in 2020" />`

Also, make sure to have the following:
  * **Compress the image as much as possible**, we recommend https://squoosh.app/
  * The output format needs to be `.webp`
  * Include a clear `alt` description for people that cannot see images

**Twitter**

To embed a tweet on your post you can use a `TwitterTweetEmbed` React component, like so:

<TwitterTweetEmbed
  tweetId='1384127726861258756'
  options={{
    cards: 'hidden',
    width: 500,
    align: 'center'
  }}
/>

**YouTube**

To embed a YouTube video use the `YouTube` React component, like so:

<YouTube id="yILtksZriqA" />

**Podcast**

To embed a Podcast audio use, like so:

<center><iframe src="https://anchor.fm/asyncapi/embed/episodes/April-2021-at-AsyncAPI-Initiative-e111lo9" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></center>
