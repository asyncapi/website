Kaixo lagunak! This week we continued working on the parser as it’s a top priority for us. We made significant progress and plan to release a simple but functional version soon.

## Building the parser

1. [We’ve added support for AsyncAPI 1.x/OpenAPI schemas](https://github.com/asyncapi/parser/pull/31). This is the first step before we dive into Avro and Protobuf support.
2. [Updated the Node.js to automatically test itself on Linux, Mac, and Windows](https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-nodejs). We’re still struggling to debug some failures on Windows so we encourage people who work on this operating system to join and help us test.

## Talks
I’ll be speaking about AsyncAPI and event-driven architectures in a few conferences. Let’s connect!

* API Days Madrid (April 26): http://apidaysmad.apiaddicts.org/schedule/#session-2
* Gartner AADI (May 20–21): https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/applications-uk
