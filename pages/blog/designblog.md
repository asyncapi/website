Every software has a design system, regardless of whether it is free or not. Suppose you are a UX researcher or designer intending to be part of an Open Source community. In that case, you can begin contributing to the research or design program by collaborating with others. This article clarifies what Open Source is and provides tips on how you can start contributing as a UX researcher or designer. In addition, I’ll share some Open Source communities that you can contribute to as a beginner.

### What is Open Source?

Open Source Software (OSS) refers to software shared with its source code, allowing users to access, modify, and distribute. OSS allows everyone to contribute to the source code, make changes, or suggest new features. You can use the code for your purpose or contribute to improving the entire project’s features.

Some examples of Open Source Software are available, including AsyncAPI, Linux Kernel, Oppia Foundation, VLC Media Player, Mozilla Firefox, Audacity, Blender, and more. These software are free to download, use, and distribute. It’s essential to recognize that some individuals put in much effort to make these projects available to a broad audience. Pursuing a career in Open Source can be beneficial, as it allows you to give back to the community and assist as many users as possible.

It is worth noting that not all open-source projects are free of charge. To determine whether a project is free, you can check the project’s LICENSE file on GitHub.

### My Experience as a Product Designer and UX Researcher in Open Source

If you want to move faster in your career, I suggest getting started contributing to Open Source projects as early as possible. As a UX personnel, working with dummy users without getting feedback can be frustrating. However, Open Source allows you to learn your expertise and receive real-time feedback from users. Additionally, the collaborative nature of Open Source provides real-life working environments.

In late 2022, I made my first Open Source contribution by designing speaker cards for the AsyncAPI Virtual Conference. When I received a notification that my pull request had been merged, I felt a sense of fulfillment about seeing my work showcased on a global scene.

My interest in Open Source Communities made me apply for the Outreachy Internship Program. My collaboration and research skills helped me get into the program. I worked on the Foundational Research for Nigeria, a research project created to understand the learning needs and problems associated with technology learning among children between the ages of 7 and 15 in Nigeria. I also conducted usability testing with Oppia users to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of the Oppia application and website platform.

Since completing my Internship Program in March, I have worked on other open-source projects.

### Completed Projects

- Designed the AsyncAPI Conference on Tour 2023 website (AACoT’23).
- Conducted a UX Design Audit on the AsyncAPI Website.
- Designed the AsyncAPI Financial Summary Page.
- Designed the Community Member’s Page for AsyncAPI.
- I worked with my team to design and create content for the Ladder Library as part of She Code Africa HackFest 2022.

### On-going Projects

- Working on the Design system for the AsyncAPI website.
- Creating a UX research plan for usability testing.
- Reviewing all design and research-related issues.

### What are the advantages of contributing?

There are numerous benefits to contributing to open source. One of the most prominent reasons is collaboration. For beginners and experienced fellows, collaborating using a version control system is an added advantage to your career. Getting hired based on your open-source contribution and contributing to technologies that make your life better and more accessible.
Finally, open source is time-consuming and can become overwhelming if you do not manage your time.

### Are you ready to start contributing?

Check if the applications you frequently use are Open Source and consider joining their communities. You can ask questions, solve issues, and offer assistance to others. Many communities offer issues that are suitable for beginners who are new to open source.
