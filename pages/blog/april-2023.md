The month of April brought some ecstatic news as AsyncAPI has been accepted as one of the participants in GSoD'23. This achievement is a result of the exceptional work done by [Alejandra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandra-quetzalli/), our lead documentation engineer and author of [Docs-as-Ecosystem](https://docsasecosystem.com/). Alejandra's contributions to the documentation process have been vital in improving the quality of AsyncAPI documentation, and her hard work has not gone unnoticed. As part of the GSoD program, Ale will be carefully reviewing and selecting the best applicants out of the 87 applications received and she'll be conducting live editing interviews. We are excited and can't wait to meet the talented individuals that will be selected as mentees as they contribute to making AsyncAPIs documentation even better with Ale's guidance and mentorship. Do check out [Alejandra's Q1 documentation report](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/2023-Q1-docs-report) to learn more about our recent efforts.

## AsyncAPI Bounty Program Trial
We are thrilled to introduce the trial launch of the AsyncAPI Bounty Program. Our objective for this program is to express our gratitude and support to our maintainers and contributors who dedicate their time and efforts to drive the initiative forward. As part of the trial, we have selected 7 projects that comprise a variety of coding, design and technical writing tasks. We invite you to explore the [projects participating in the trial run](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+org%3Aasyncapi+label%3A%22bounty%22).

## Code of Conduct Refresh
AsyncAPI has been growing exponentially and to maintain a safe and inclusive environment for all community members it is important that we refresh our Code of Conduct. Our goal is to thrive to make sure that the community remains welcoming, respectful and supportive. Please do share your thoughts and suggestions in this [open discussion](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/682).

## Call for Speakers Madrid 
AsyncAPI Conf on Tour 2023 (AACoT) is coming to Madrid on the 18th - 19th of October. The [Call for Speakers of AACoT Madrid Edition](https://sessionize.com/aacot-madrid/) is now open and we looking for diverse talks ranging from community, API design, and best practices. We welcome both first-time and returning speakers to submit their proposals. We can't wait to see you there!

## Spec x Tooling
We are excited to announce the release of the new [Parser-API v1.0.0](https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-api). The API follows an intent-driven design approach that prioritizes the user's purpose over technical mechanics. To learn more about the functionalities, please refer to [this detailed article](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/intent-driven-api).

There won't be any spec v2.7 release as the April release window was not used. We haven't pushed any specific features and we are still on the lookout for a release coordinator. If you are interested please indicate in the `#spec` channel on Slack. We are hands-on in completing Spec v3.0 and hopefully, this will be done in June. You can follow all the [updates on this issue](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/issues/691#issuecomment-1488873682).

## AsyncAPI Mentorship Program
The AsyncAPI Mentorship Program Cohort 2 is now ready for kickoff. This year we are excited to not only accept code-related projects but also expand to technical writing and design. Whether you are interested in participating or have project ideas, we encourage you to engage [in the discussions](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/689).

## Women in Open Source
[Barbano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbano-gonzalez-moreno) Lead Education Program Manager and Ambassador Program Lead is currently working on an article that highlights the contributions of women in the open-source community. Through her research, she's focusing on exploring various case studies to gain deeper insights into the number of women involved in the field, where they're located and the specific work they do. Barbano aims to increase community visibility of women in open source and to showcase the valuable impact they have in the industry.
