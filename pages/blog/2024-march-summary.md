Additionally, we welcome back [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/en) back as our Bronze sponsor for 2024. We extend our gratitude to [Hugo Guerrero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-guerrero), our AsyncAPI Ambassador, for connecting the right people from RedHat.

We encourage organizations to support the initiative by getting involved either financially, through employee participation, service provision, or hosting an AsyncAPI event. Please refer [to our AsyncAPI Financial Summary](https://www.asyncapi.com/finance) for a detailed breakdown.


## AsyncAPI Conf on Tour
The call for speakers for [AACoT'24 Helsinki Edition](https://conference.asyncapi.com/venue/Helsinki) has ended, and we will soon add the speakers, agenda, and ticket information [to the AsyncAPI conference website](conference.asyncapi.com). 

If you missed the deadline for submitting a talk, we are happy to share that the proposals for AACoT'24 London will soon be open. Be sure to start drafting your proposals and prepare to join us in September.

## Spec X Tooling
It's been a while since we released [AsyncAPI v3](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/release-notes-3.0.0), and its adoption and support over the past few months have been amazing. We are happy to share some of the projects that are doing cool stuff with v3:


- ### Microcks
[Microcks](https://microcks.io/) is an open-source cloud-native platform for mocking and testing contracts. It is designed to work in isolation and cut dependencies, making contract testing easier. Microcks supports various protocols, including AsyncAPI, REST, and OpenAPI. It is the first open-source tool under the CNCF Sandbox project to officially support AsyncAPI v3; read all about it in the [Microcks v1.9 release article](https://microcks.io/blog/microcks-1.9.0-release/).

Check out [this live demo on Test Containers and AsyncAPI/Kafka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsTj0hyYiAA&t=262s) to learn more.


- ### Springwolf
[Springwolf](https://www.springwolf.dev/docs/introduction/) is an open-source project that streamlines the documentation process for event-driven apps. It focuses on documenting asynchronous APIs using the AsyncAPI v3 specification. With Springwolf, you can easily generate comprehensive API documentation from your codebase by leveraging your application's metadata, such as listener annotations like @KafkaListener, @RabbitListener, and @SqsListener. It also includes springwolf-ui, a user-friendly web interface allowing easy publication of events to document channels.

Be sure to test and try [Springwolf's live demo and documentation](https://www.springwolf.dev/).

- ### Java Code Generator
We are excited to share that the [Java code generator](https://lnkd.in/d4jeDmMv) now supports AsyncAPI v3 and is the first generator template to support v3. Thanks to [Dale Lane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalelane/) and other IBM folks for contributing to this milestone in developing AsyncAPI tools. 

Read how you can [Accelerate event-driven projects with AsyncAPI v3](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/integration/blogs/dale-lane1/2024/03/21/asyncapi-3) for more details.

- ### jasyncapi
The [jasyncapi](https://github.com/asyncapi/jasyncapi) is a Java code-first tool for the AsyncAPI specification that now supports V3, thanks to [Pavel Bodiachevskii](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavel-bo/) and other contributors. Be sure to [check the latest jasyncapi release](https://github.com/asyncapi/jasyncapi/releases/tag/1.0.0-EAP-3) for breaking changes.


## AsyncAPI Bounty Program
We are excited that the AsyncAPI Bounty Program Q2 is already underway after the success of the first quarter. Though we had one issue that wasn't completed,  it resulted in the participant's suspension until the 3rd quarter; we are happy that the ball is rolling forward. 

We still have a few issues that haven't been assigned yet. If you are interested, be sure to check the [Bounty Program Board](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/projects/36/views/4?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=bounty%2F2024-Q2). 

## Community Discussions

### AsyncAPI Working Groups
After officially establishing Working Groups in the initiative, we are happy to share that we now have the following:
- **Developer Experience Working Group**. This group aims to empower the AsyncAPI user journey through intuitive onboarding, tools, and a frictionless experience. If you want to join the working group or would like to read more about it, please check out the [Developer Experience Working Group discussion](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1099).
- **Community Growth Working Group**. This group's goal is to ensure that the AsyncAPI community grows in a healthy and sustainable way. If you're interested, you can participate by commenting on the [Community Growth Working Group discussion](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1094).
- **Essential Building Blocks Working Group**. The goal is to provide fundamental building blocks that enable a similar developer experience across languages such as C#/.NET, Kotlin, Java, Go, Python,  and TypeScript/JavaScript. Anyone can join and contribute by sharing their interest in the [Essential Building Blocks Working Group discussion](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1128).

### Marketing
We have started moving forward with the marketing discussion and had a meeting to streamline the work; please [watch the marketing recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLE8ta4xn3g) or [listen through Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5lTXkF1uYogJS7WM1x2ukN?si=5856a9bab3414439) for more context. One way we are moving forward with the discussion is to create a marketing working group and start inviting experts and sponsors to join us. We have also outlined some recommendations for hiring someone full-time to handle this aspect. If you want to help us with our planned steps or join the efforts, please [share your comments on the Marketing activity discussion](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1062).

## TSC x Ambassadors
We are excited to welcome [Giri Venkatesan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/girivenkatesan), Developer Advocate at Solace, as the latest addition to the [AsyncAPI Ambassadors](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/ambassadors).
