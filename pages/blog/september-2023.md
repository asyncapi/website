Our first in-person AsyncAPI Conf on Tour took place on the 20th of September, hosted by IBM in London. The day was packed with excellent sessions from esteemed industry experts. Although we planned the conference during the summer holidays, the turnout was great, and it was nice to finally interact with people who support and use AsyncAPI in person. We are excited and pleased to have received positive feedback from the participants, and we are grateful to the speakers for the informative sessions while enriching the event.
