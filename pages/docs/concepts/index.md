Welcome to AsyncAPI **Concepts**! Our Concepts section will define the concepts of AsyncAPI features and capabilities.

<Remember>

## Contribute to AsyncAPI Concepts
Code isn't the only way to contribute to OSS; Dev Docs are a **huge** help that benefit the entire OSS ecosystem. At AsyncAPI, we value Doc contributions as much as every other type of contribution. ‚ù§Ô∏è

To get started as a Docs contributor:
1. Familiarize yourself with our <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">project's Contribution Guide</a> and our <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" target="_blank">Code of Conduct</a>.
2. Head over to our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/projects/12" target="_blank">AsyncAPI Docs Board</a>.
3. Pick an issue you would like to contribute to and leave a comment introducing yourself. This is also the perfect place to leave any questions you may have on how to get started. 
4. If there is no work done in that Docs issue yet, feel free to open a PR and get started!

### Docs contributor questions
Do you have a documentation contributor question and you're wondering how to tag me into a GitHub discussion or PR? Never fear!

Tag me in your AsyncAPI Doc PRs or <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/community/discussions/categories/docs" target="_blank">GitHub Discussions</a> via my GitHub handle, <a href="https://github.com/alequetzalli" target="_blank">alequetzalli</a>
