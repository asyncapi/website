## What is a Server?
APIs use servers to receive requests from a user and responds back with the required information. In a nutshell, a server is a middle man between a user and the stored information inside a database. The communication between a user and the database happens in the form of HTTP messages. One thing to note, servers cannot make any requests, and the user canâ€™t respond as all interactions are instigated by the user.

## Purpose of Servers in Event-Driven Architectures
Servers play an important role in event-driven architecture, as they create a relationship between an application and clients or/consumers. When designing and setting up an event-driven application, servers are in charge of delivering asynchronous messages to the consumer. With the integration of Websocket APIs, servers can create and maintain the server-client connection or server to server connections.
