## What is a Server?
APIs use servers to receive requests from a user and responds back with the required information. In a nutshell, a server is a middle man between a user and the stored information inside a database. The communication between a user and the database happens in the form of HTTP messages. One thing to note, servers cannot make any requests, and the user canâ€™t respond as all interactions are instigated by the user.
