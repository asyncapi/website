## Welcome to AsyncAPI Docs! 

AsyncAPI is an open source initiative that seeks to improve the current state of Event-Driven Architectures (EDA). Event-Driven Architecture is a method of designing software systems where different parts of the system talk to each other by sending messages called events. These events represent important actions or changes that happen in the system. When an event happens, it triggers a response in other parts of the system, leading to a chain of events. This allows the system to respond quickly and handle lots of events at once. Our long-term goal is to make working with EDAs as easy as working with REST APIs. That goes from documentation to code generation, from discovery to event management, and beyond.
