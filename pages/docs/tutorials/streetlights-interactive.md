Please try out [this](https://www.katacoda.com/asyncapi/scenarios/streetlight-tut) interactive tutorial and let us know what you think, as we plan to have all the docs written this way.<!--more-->

One of the most critical roadmap items for the AsyncAPI Initiative for 2020 is **Make it super easy for people to get started with AsyncAPI**. One of the crucial things here is to put a lot of love into the documentation.

Before we start writing more docs and improve their structure, we need first to know how you want you to interact with docs. We need to see if you prefer classic plain-text docs or rather interactive docs where you can play with the content.

We created an interactive tutorial using [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/). It is another version of the [Streetlights](./streetlights) tutorial that will always work for you no matter what operating system do you have.

Please become our alpha testers of the tutorial:

1. Go through the tutorial [here](https://www.katacoda.com/asyncapi/scenarios/streetlight-tut)
