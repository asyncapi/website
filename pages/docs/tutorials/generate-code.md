## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to generate code from your AsyncAPI document using [Glee](https://github.com/asyncapi/glee).

## Background context
[Glee](https://github.com/asyncapi/glee) is a TS/JS framework that enables you to create APIs and messaging clients based on the AsyncAPI document. Instead of generating code, this framework tightly integrates with your AsyncAPI document and binds functions to specific
AsyncAPI operations. You only have to provide the code for these functions and Glee will take care of the rest.

Glee is often used with the [AsyncAPI CLI](/tools/cli) for a better development experience.

## Installation guide
<Remember>

It is important to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed which will enable the installation of the required dependencies using <b>npm</b>.

</Remember>

import CliInstallation from '../../../assets/docs/fragments/cli-installation.md'

## Create a Glee project

1. Trigger the creation of the Glee project:
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
    {`asyncapi new glee --name=tutorial`}
    </CodeBlock>

    Let's break down the previous command:
    - `asyncapi new glee` is how you use Glee via the AsyncAPI CLI. 
    - `--name=tutorial` is how you tell the AsyncAPI CLI to name your new Glee project. 

2. List all files in directory and check that the Glee project is created:
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
    {`cd tutorial && ls`}
    </CodeBlock>

    Upon execution of the command above, the following is an example of the expected result:
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
    {`$ ls
    LICENSE
    README.md
    asyncapi.yaml
    functions
    package-lock.json
    package.json`}
    </CodeBlock>

    By default, Glee provides a sample `asyncapi.yaml` file. If you want to use the [AsyncAPI document created in the previous tutorial](https://asyncapi.com/docs/tutorials/create-asyncapi-document), either replace the file if you have it somewhere else or generate a new one by running `rm asyncapi.yaml && asyncapi new --example=tutorial.yml --no-tty`.

3. Create the necessary functions:
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
    {`touch functions/onLightMeasured.js`}
    </CodeBlock>

    <Remember>

    If you look at the content of the `functions` folder, you should also see another file named `onHello.js`. You can safely delete it
    by running `rm functions/onHello.js`. 

    </Remember>

## Start generated application
1. Install dependencies of the newly generated application:
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
    {`npm install`}
    </CodeBlock>

2. Start the application:
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
    {`npm run dev`}
    </CodeBlock>

## Send message to broker
1. In another terminal install the MQTT.js library:
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
    {`npm install mqtt -g`}
    </CodeBlock>

2. Send a message to the MQTT broker that's connected to your generated application. Run the following MQTT client command:
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
    {`mqtt pub -t 'light/measured' -h 'test.mosquitto.org' -m '{"id": 1, "lumens": 3, "sentAt": "2017-06-07T12:34:32.000Z"}'`}
    </CodeBlock>

3. Go back to the previous terminal to check if your application logged the streetlight condition you just sent. You should see something like this displayed in the terminal:
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
    {`light/measured was received:
    { id: 1, lumens: 3, sentAt: '2017-06-07T12:34:32.000Z' }`}
    </CodeBlock>
## Summary
In this tutorial, you learned how to create a Glee project from the [Streetlights API specification document created in a previous tutorial](https://asyncapi.com/docs/tutorials/create-asyncapi-document). 

Additionally, you've learned how to run your code by installingÂ the project's dependencies and sending several test messages to the Streelights application using the MQTT client.

## Next steps
Now that you've completed this tutorial, go ahead and learn how to [validate your AsyncAPI messages (events)](https://asyncapi.com/docs/tutorials/message-validation) through the message validation techniques supported by AsyncAPI.
