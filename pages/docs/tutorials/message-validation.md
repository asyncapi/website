# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to validate the messages in your AsyncAPI document after creating your application in runtime.
You will create an application using Node.js.
- Your application will connect to the message broker and receive a stream of events/ messages.
- Message validator will check the messages and whether it's a publish or subscribe message.
- Message validator reads the AsyncAPI document if it is valid or not and returns an error if it is invalid.
You will learn about application run time, messages and creating an AsyncAPI file to describe your API and generate code from it.
