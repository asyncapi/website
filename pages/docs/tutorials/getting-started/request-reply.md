In this tutorial, you'll learn how to implement the request/reply pattern in an AsyncAPI document using a straightforward pong-pong example.

Before we begin, it would be beneficial for you to have a basic understanding of AsyncAPI and Event-Driven Architectures (EDA). If you need a refresher, refer to our [Event-Driven Architecture](/docs/tutorials/getting-started/event-driven-architectures) document.

[Request/reply](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/RequestReply.html) is a messaging pattern involving two key components: the **requester**, which sends a request message, and the **replier**, responsible for receiving this request and responding with a reply. This pattern fundamentally revolves around these two roles, requester and replier.

## Static reply address 

Here's how you can implement the request/reply pattern when the response address is known at the compile or design time. 

A requester can be configured with the `send` operation, where it dispatches a message to the `ping` channel and anticipates receiving a response through the `pong` channel.

In the below example, the `Operation Reply` object within the `pingRequest` operation provides essential details, like the destination for the reply, which is the `pong` channel. Since the `pong` channel is configured with only one message, there's no need to explicitly define the reply message. Similarly, the `ping` channel has just one message, eliminating the need to specify the message sent in the request.

## Dynamic reply address 

Occasionally, the destination for a reply cannot be predetermined during the design or compile phase. In such cases, the address for the reply is dynamically determined at runtime, allowing for more flexible and adaptive communication.

In scenarios where the address or reply channel is unknown at design time, the `address` property can either be set to `null` or omitted entirely. To define the reply address dynamically, the `Operation Reply Address` object can be used, allowing for runtime expressions. That enables the `requester` to specify where the `replier` should send the reply, detailing the address's location and its specific position within the request.

In this situation, the `location` property is assigned the runtime expression `$message.header#/replyTo`. Such an expression indicates that the address for the reply is located within the header of the request, specifically in the `replyTo` field. This method dynamically determines the reply address based on the content of the request header.

While the above examples are a simple implementation of the request/reply pattern, in a protocol-agnostic world there are many different ways to represent the request/reply pattern. All of which are supported by AsyncAPI.
