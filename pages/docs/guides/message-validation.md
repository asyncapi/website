description: In this guide, you'll learn how to validate messages/events in AsyncAPI in runtime.

# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to validate the messages in your AsyncAPI document after creating your application in runtime.
You will create an application using Node.js.
- Your application will connect to the message broker and receive a stream of events/ messages.
- Message validator will check the message name, payload, channel and operation (publish/subscribe)
- Message validator reads the AsyncAPI document if it is valid or not and returns an error if it is invalid.
You will learn about application run time, messages and creating an AsyncAPI file to describe your API and generate code from it.

# Prerequisites

You'll use Node.js to code the API. The selected technology is irrelevant here, since everything explained in this tutorial is applicable to any other programming language and message brokers.

Before you proceed to the next stage, you'll need to download a few things:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v15 or newer).

2. Install Git based on your Operating System:
    - [Install Git on MacOs](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
    - [Install Git on Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
    - [Install Git on Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

# Validation of messages

Validation of messages can be done in these scenarios

- [asyncapi-validator](https://github.com/WaleedAshraf/asyncapi-validator), it validates your messages against your AsyncAPI schema.
- [AsyncAPI event gateway](https://github.com/asyncapi/event-gateway), it is not a library that you intergrate in an App, but validation is done before the message gets into the app, on a gateway.

# Validation using AsyncAPI Validator

It is a message validator through AsyncAPI schema. 
1. In order to validate messages, you need to install this package
<CodeBlock language="bash"> 
{`npm i asyncapi-validator`} 
</CodeBlock>

2. To validate messages using `messageId`
Here messageId should be as defined in [AsyncAPI Schema v2.4.0](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.4.0#messageObject).
<CodeBlock>
{`.validateByMessageId(key, payload)`}
</CodeBlock>

3. To validate messages using `.validate()` method you should provide `msgIdentifier` in AsyncApiValidator `options`.

<CodeBlock>
{`.validate(key, payload, channel, operation)`}
</CodeBlock>

# Here's an example usecase with `.validateByMessageId()` method

1. Let's first create the AsyncAPI file
<CodeBlock language="yaml">
{`cat <<EOT >> asyncapi.yaml
asyncapi: 2.0.0
info:
  title: User Events
  version: 1.0.0
channels:
  user-events:
    description: user related events
    publish:
      message:
        name: UserDeletedMessage
        x-custom-key: UserDeleted
        payload:
          type: object
          properties:
            userEmail:
              type: string
            userId:
              type: string
              EOT`}
              </CodeBlock>

2. Now by using `asyncapi-validator`.To validate incoming MQTT messages, you have to load the AsyncAPI schema definition using the `fromSource` method and then you can validate any message with its key and payload using the validate method.

<CodeBlock>
{`const AsyncApiValidator = require('asyncapi-validator')
let va = await AsyncApiValidator.fromSource('./api.yaml')
// validate messageId 'UserRemoved'
va.validateByMessageId('UserRemoved', {
  userId: '123456789',
  userEmail: 'alex@mail.com',
})`}
</CodeBlock>

# Here's an example usecase with .validate() method

1. Let's create another AsyncAPI file

<CodeBlock language="yaml">
{`asyncapi: 2.0.0
info:
  title: User Events
  version: 1.0.0
channels:
  user-events:
    description: user related events
    publish:
      message:
        name: UserDeletedMessage
        x-custom-key: UserDeleted
        payload:
          type: object
          properties:
            userEmail:
              type: string
            userId:
              type: string`}
              </CodeBlock>

2. Now by using `asyncapi-validator`. here "msgIdentifier" is "x-custom-key". That is why, "UserDeleted" is used as "key" in "va.validate()" method.

<CodeBlock>
{`const AsyncApiValidator = require('asyncapi-validator')
let va = await AsyncApiValidator.fromSource('./api.yaml', {msgIdentifier: 'x-custom-key'})
// validate 'UserDeleted' on channel 'user-events' with operation 'publish'
va.validate('UserDeleted', {
  userId: '123456789',
  userEmail: 'alex@mail.com',
}, 'user-events', 'publish')`}
</CodeBlock>

# Validation using AsyncAPI gateway

AsyncAPI gateway intercepts all incoming messages moving them into a pipeline of middlewares and handlers such as Message validator.As per today, only the Kafka protocol is supported.

# Here's an example usecase using AsyncAPI gateway

1. Let's create the AsyncAPI file. Expected messages are based on a small portion of the StreetLights tutorial.

<CodeBlock language="yaml">
{`asyncapi: '2.4.0'

            minimum: 0
            maximum: 100`}
</CodeBlock>

2. The gateway accepts the light measured `lightMeasured` as a message to inform about environmental lighting conditions of a particular streetlight.

<CodeBlock>
{`lumens      integer >= 0
Light intensity measured in lumens.
sentAt      string format: date-time uid: sentAt
Date and time when the message was sent.`}

</CodeBlock>

3. It returns the error when it detects the following invalid message `invalidMessage`

<CodeBlock>
{`UUID       string
           Unique identifier of message. I.e. Kafka message key.
Payload    string
           Message value. I.e. Kafka message (base64).`}
</CodeBlock>
