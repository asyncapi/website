# Code Generators

The following is a list of tools that generate code from an AsyncAPI document, and not the other way around.

| Link           | Description    | Language/Framework |
| :------------- | :------------- | :----------------- |
| [AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator) | Use your AsyncAPI definition to generate literally anything. Markdown documentation, Node.js code, Java code, HTML documentation, anything! **[Click here](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aasyncapi+topic%3Agenerator+topic%3Atemplate) to get a list of the existing templates**. | Node.js/Hermes, Java/Spring, Markdown, HTML, and more.

# DSL

Writing YAML by hand is no fun, and maybe you don't want a GUI, so use a Domain Specific Language to write AsyncAPI in your language of choice.

| Link           | Description    | Language/Kind |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| [BOATS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/boats) | Compile your single AsyncAPI file from multiple components and with the help of the template engine Nunjucks plus a few extra helpers. Once compiled BOATS calls in [AsyncAPI Parser](https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js) to validate. | JS |

The following is a list of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that you can use in your workflows:

| Link           | Description    |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| [AsyncAPI Github Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/asyncapi-github-action) | This action validates if the AsyncAPI schema file is valid or not.
| [Generator for AsyncAPI documents](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/generator-for-asyncapi-documents) | This action generates whatever you want using your AsyncAPI document. It uses [AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator).
| [API documentation on Bump](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/api-documentation-on-bump) | With this Github Action you can automatically generate your API reference (with changelog and diff) on [Bump](https://bump.sh) from any AsyncAPI file.

# Mocking and Testing {#mocking}

Tools that take specification documents as input, then publish fake messages to broker destinations for simulation purpose. May also check that publisher messages are compliant with schemas.

| Link           | Description    | Language/Kind |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
