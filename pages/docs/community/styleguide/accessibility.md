## Accessibility

At AsyncAPI, we strive to make our documentation/content inclusive, accessible, and unbiased to everyone. We encourage all contributors to have diversity and inclusivity in mind when writing. To ensure this, we have provided an overview of general guidelines.

### Language
- Be clear and concise when writing. Avoid the use of complex language or technical jargon. For example, instead of using "*MQTT Server Binding*," it could be simplified to "*Protocol-specific information for an MQTT server*," or "*WebSockets Operation Binding*" can be explained as "*Protocol-specific information for WebSockets operation*."
- Keep paragraphs and sentences short, simple, and to the point.
- Always maintain a uniform structure. Use descriptive headings and subheadings to make navigation easy.
- Use inclusive language and always keep the reader in mind when writing. 


### Text
- Use the appropriate heading hierarchy. H1 is used for the main heading while H2 to H6 are used for subsection headings. 
- Properly align text for easy readability.
- Avoid using camel case or any unnecessary fonts and formatting.
- Define acronyms or abbreviations upon the first use in your documentation, and always spell out any signs or symbols.
- Structure your text in a uniform format by maintaining consistent structure throughout your docs. Accurately provide clear and concise descriptions of AsyncAPI concepts and elements as referenced throughout the documentation. 

### Links
- Use descriptive and meaningful link text. Avoid using phrases like *click here* or *follow this link*. Instead, opt for more specific and informative options like *read more about asynchronous API* or *view our content roadmap*.
- Make sure your links or URLs are valid and redirect to the correct destination.
- Use internal links when referring to a section within the same documentation. External links, on the other hand, should be utilized when referencing additional resources from different websites.
- When using external links, ensure your referencing information is relevant to your documentation. If you're referring to external resources or documentation, please ensure they meet the appropriate standards for AsyncAPI.

### Multimedia
- When adding alt text, providing clear and descriptive information is essential. Avoid using generic terms like "*diagram*," "*image,*" or "*code*", and instead provide specific details such as "*Diagram of a server concept*" or "*Code snippet showing CLI usage*".
- Always use text rather than images, unless necessary. For instance, when explaining complex technical concepts, images convey information better. 
- Use WebP instead of PNG, SVG, or JPEG. It retains quality.
- Provide transcripts and captions for video content.
- Make sure your captions can be translated into various languages.
- Avoid auto-playing media; always provide controls.

### User Interface (UI)
- Use the correct terminologies for UI elements. Avoid using phrases like "*click here*" or "*this button*", and instead opt for descriptive labels such as "*next button*" or "*Go back*". This will allow users to understand the functionality of each UI element better.
- Format tables correctly and keep the text within the grid. This involves using table headers and row/column headers. Make sure tables are user-friendly, easy to navigate, and understandable.
-  Add icons to describe a function. Use the aria-label attribute when unsure of the icon name to provide a text alternative to elements that lack accurate descriptions.

## Colors
- It is important to choose color contrasts that ensure user-readability.
- Diagrams and images must always follow and respect [color contrast accessibility rules](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
