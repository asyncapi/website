# Link Style Guide ðŸ“ƒ

Links are an essential part of any written content, as they allow readers to quickly navigate to other related information. A well-designed link structure can greatly enhance the user experience, while a poorly designed one can be confusing and frustrating. In this style guide, we will outline the guidelines for designing links in text, assets, and external links.

## Link Text

- Use descriptive and concise text that accurately reflects the content of the linked page. For example: **"Learn more about AsyncAPI"** instead of **"click here"**.
- Avoid using general words such as "click here" or "read more."
- Make sure the link text accurately describes the target of the link. For example: **"Check out the latest version of AsyncAPI"** instead of **"click here for more information"**.
- For external links, it is recommended to indicate that it is an external link by using the text **external link**.

## External Links

- Use target=**"_blank"** attribute to open external links in a new tab. This makes it easier for the user to return to the original page.
- Ensure that the external links open in a new tab or window, and not in the same tab, so as to avoid losing the original page. For example, if you click on an external link, a new tab should open and the original page should still be accessible.

## Link Structure

- Use a consistent link structure throughout the content. For example, using the same color and underline style for all links.
- Make sure that the links are easily distinguishable from the rest of the text. You can use different colors for links so that links can be easily separated.
- Avoid using too many links in one section, as it can be distracting and overwhelming for the reader. For example, having only 2-3 links in a section of text.
