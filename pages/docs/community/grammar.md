## Abbreviations and Acronyms

When using an abbreviation or acronym for the first time, spell it out and include the shortest form in parentheses. 

Abbreviations are meant to be used to save the reader’s time. They make your documentation look clean. However, using abbreviations may come with some downsides. Abbreviations add a layer of abstraction to text, which in turn requires the reader to spend some mental energy to expand. Thus, it is best to add abbreviations in case of words that have been repeatedly used throughout your document. 

Here are some examples of abbreviations:
-‘Event-driven architecture’ can be abbreviated as ‘EDA’
- ‘Producer Consumer Model’ can be abbreviated as ‘PCM’

‘Abbreviations usually take the first few letters of a word and also end in a full-stop. On the other hand, acronyms are mostly formed from the first letter of each word in a phrase.’ - IELTS

Here are some examples of acronyms:
- ‘Artificial Intelligence’ can be acronymized as ‘AI’
- ‘Application Programming Interface’ can be acronymized as ‘API’


## Active voice

Prefer active voice over passive voice whenever possible. Active voice makes writing easier to read and understand. When combined with short sentences, it makes it easy to convey an idea to the reader.

Passive: ‘The documentation is being read by Charlie.’
Active: ‘Charlie is reading the documentation.’

## Capitalization

Follow standard [capitalization rules](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/mechanics/help_with_capitals.html) for American English. Avoid using unnecessary capitalization.

Here are some examples of when capitalization should be used:
- The first letter of any sentence should be capitalized
- Trademarked words that include capital letters
- Names of programming languages or frameworks 

## Spelling

Prefer American English over its counterparts. For example, use 'color' instead of 'colour'.

## Verb tense

Stick with the present tense wherever possible. However, in some cases, using the future tense might be unavoidable.
