## Maintainers 

AsyncAPI is actively maintained by:

- [Fran Méndez](https://twitter.com/fmvilas) - Project Director.
- [Łukasz Górnicki](https://twitter.com/derberq) - Maintainer and Dev Community Keeper.

So far, we have had many contributors and we are thankful for their time and help.

## Contributors

We do our best to recognize every contribution to the project. We do it individually in every repository from [AsyncAPI GitHub organization](https://github.com/asyncapi/). There should always be a **Contributors** section in the readme, like [this one](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/README.md#contributors). We use [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/specification) specification to handle recognitions. 

We apologize in advance if we failed in recognizing your work. Feel free to contact us on [slack](https://www.asyncapi.com/slack-invite/) and we will fix it immediately, or just talk to [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org) bot.

## History

This project started at Hitch (a.k.a. API Changelog). We are in love with API machine-readable documentation formats (OpenAPI, RAML, etc.) and always encouraged our customers to use a machine-readable definition for their APIs because it allows them to get extra benefits. From documentation and code generation to setup their own [API Assistant](http://apiassistant.com).

Internally, we used a message-driven microservices architecture and we couldn't have all those tools that we have with the HTTP APIs. All those things you get because you have your API defined with a machine-readable documentation format. And, on top of that, we noticed that some of our customers were creating IoT APIs over MQTT and they couldn't get all the benefits from Hitch because the existing specifications don't support message-driven APIs.

**It was time to come up with something good enough for everyone instead of having every company doing its own battle. We can learn a lot together if we join forces, so we decided to create AsyncAPI!**
