# Accessibility

At AsyncAPI, we strive to make our documentation/content inclusive, accessible, and unbiased to everyone. We encourage all contributors to have diversity and inclusivity in mind when writing. To ensure this, we have provided an overview of general guidelines to follow.

## Language
- Be clear and concise when writing. Avoid the use of complex language, technical jargon, and verbose explanations.
- Keep paragraphs and sentences short, simple, and on point.
- Always maintain a uniform structure. Use descriptive headings and subheadings to make navigation easy.
- Avoid using camel case or any unnecessary fonts and formatting.
- Always have the reader in mind when writing. Use appropriate and approved terminologies when describing disabilities.
