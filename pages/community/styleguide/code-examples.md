Code examples added must be straightforward enough to understand for all audiences and include line-by-line comments.

Add practical code examples adhering to industry standards, as users may copy and run the sample code in production. Be sure to include comments with warnings on what may occur when running that code. Make no assumptions about the reader's familiarity with libraries, frameworks, preprocessors, or other non-native features.
Clarify when you're adding a code snippet and not a complete example. Provide information about any packages or dependencies required to run the sample code.

Code examples should be self-explanatory and easy to understand. The goal is to provide simplified working examples that can be understood as soon as possible, not necessarily to create efficient, brilliant code that impresses experts and has outstanding utility.


## Formatting 

### Code Length

- Ideally, code lines shouldn't be so long that reading them horizontally requires scrolling.

- For the sake of readability, break large lines at appropriate moments, but never at the price of acceptable practises.

- Add bullet points for better readability and understandability.


### Colors

- Using different colors for making the code more readable and understandable.
Add different color to `tags` and `code` is a good practice.

- Code blocks that show good habits to adopt are shown with a green check mark in the right corner, while those that show bad habits are shown with a white cross inside a red circle.

- You different colors for bracket to know the starting and ending bracket of code block.

### Spacing and Indentation

- Put the characters for the open-brace ("") on the same line as the sentence that opens the block.

- In all code samples, the indentation should be two spaces per tab.

- Add proper spacing between code blocks

- After adding comments ,start writing code from the next line.
### General

Make no assumptions about the reader's familiarity with any libraries, frameworks, preprocessors, or other non-native features. 

Write your code to be as clean and understandable as possible

Add links of the library or documentation for better understanding.
