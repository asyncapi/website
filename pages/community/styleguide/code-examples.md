Code examples added must be straightforward enough to understand for all audiences and include line-by-line comments.

Add practical code examples adhering to industry standards, as users may copy and run the sample code in production. Be sure to include comments with warnings on what may occur when running that code. Make no assumptions about the reader's familiarity with libraries, frameworks, preprocessors, or other non-native features.
Clarify when you're adding a code snippet and not a complete example. Provide information about any packages or dependencies required to run the sample code.

Code examples should be self-explanatory and easy to understand. The goal is to provide simplified working examples that can be understood as soon as possible, not necessarily to create efficient, brilliant code that impresses experts and has outstanding utility.


## Formatting 

### Code length

- Ideally, code lines shouldn't be so long that reading them horizontally requires scrolling.

- For the sake of readability, break large lines at appropriate moments, but never at the price of acceptable practises.


### Colors
Color plays an important role in syntax highlighting, making code samples easier to read and understand code. Use color in a consistent and accessible way to make code examples accessible to everyone.

- Use a color scheme that is accessible: Ensure the color scheme meets accessibility standards. This means using colors that have enough contrast to be easily distinguishable from each other. 
- Use color to differentiate between elements: Color can be used to differentiate between different elements in your code, such as keywords, variables, and comments. This makes it easier to quickly identify and understand the different parts of the code.
- Test your code with color blindness simulators: There are many different types of color blindness, and it's important to ensure your code is readable for people with all types of color blindness. Use color blindness simulators to test how your code appears to users with different types of color blindness.


### Spacing and indentation

- Place the characters for the open-brace ("") on the same line.
  
- In all code samples, the indentation should be two spaces per tab.

- Add proper spacing between code blocks

- After adding comments, start writing code from the next line.
