# Content Buckets
To structure our documentation, we adopt a systematic approach from the Diátaxis framework. We ensure our docs are presented in a manner that is easy to understand by organizing and classifying them into content buckets.

At AsyncAPI our docs are classified into the following content buckets:

- **Concepts** - This section is where we define various features and capabilities AsyncAPI offers. All docs pages under this bucket need to be accurate, easy to understand and accompanied by an engineering diagram. We utilize [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) syntax to create diagrams and visualizations.

- **Tutorials** - Our tutorial section offers practical guidance to individuals who are beginners or new to AsyncAPI. Docs under this content bucket need to be hands-on and provide step-by-step guidance using real-world examples. The docs should be engaging and interactive to help users develop the required knowledge.
