                It all starts with a vision. <strong>This is where we want to see AsyncAPI by 2026.</strong> To make this vision a reality, we've set some goals below that will help us to get there.

                    Nobody does only event-driven architectures. Most people complement them with REST (OpenAPI), GraphQL, and/or RPC APIs. <strong>We want people to use the AsyncAPI specification and tooling together with their existing OpenAPI, GraphQL, and gRPC definitions.</strong> For that purpose, our specification and tools will need to understand and leverage many other specifications and tools.
