      <p>We should improve our documentation and tutorials to cover a full getting started guide, many different use cases, and examples of how AsyncAPI can be used with different protocols. From beginner to advanced, step by step. Our documentation should start looking a little bit more like a game: enjoyable and interactive.</p>

So what if neither design-first nor code-first? Or what if it's actually a mix? We should find the right balance between the two so documentation and code are both somehow "linked" and impossible to get wrong.

    description: <>
      <p>The current specification has two big structural problems right now:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Publish and subscribe verbs are not clear and most people get confused. It's also very probable we end up adding more verbs to accommodate requests, responses, queries, mutations, etc.</li>
        <li>Reusing channels across APIs is hard because the <code>publish</code> or <code>subscribe</code> verb is included in the channel definition.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Before we proceed with adding more features to the spec, we should fix these structural problems. Otherwise, changing the spec afterward is going to be a mess.</p>

    description: <>
      <p>When doing EDAs, there is a common problem that repeats across many companies, especially the big ones. People are not able to answer the question "who is subscribing to this topic/channel?". This management problem derives into a more serious one: someone makes a breaking change on the information sent on one channel and others break because they were not aware of this change. Hopefully, the subscribers break in a "noisy" way so you can detect the error and fix it. Other people opt for not pushing breaking changes into an existing channel and decide to create a new one, leading to a pile of unused channels over time.</p>
      <p>The problem I just described actually consists of two parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Lack of discovery tools for EDAs. E.g., being able to answer the question "who is subscribing to this channel?"</li>
        <li>Lack of management tools for EDAs. E.g., making sure only the right data gets into a channel.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This outcome is about the second part: "Lack of management tools for EDAs".</p>
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>User is able to make sure only well-formed messages reach the broker.</li>
        <li>It should not be needed to change a single line of code.</li>
        <li>It works with the main protocols: HTTP, Kafka, AMQP 0-9-1, AMQP 1.0, WebSockets, MQTT, and MQTT5.</li>
      </ol>
