                AsyncAPI becomes the #1 API specification for defining and developing APIs. <span className="text-green-400 block underline">Any kind of APIs.</span>

                It all starts with a vision. <strong>This is where we want to see AsyncAPI by 2026.</strong> To make this vision a reality, we've set some goals below that will help us to get there.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-500 lg:pr-4">
                These goals are not necessarily everything we'll have to do to get to that vision but instead, they are manageable objectives we can already anticipate. <strong>Together, vision and goals set the direction of the project.</strong>

                    AsyncAPI unifies all the API specifications
                  </h2>
                  <p className="my-4 text-gray-600 lg:text-center">
                    Nobody does only event-driven architectures. Most people complement them with REST (OpenAPI), GraphQL, and/or RPC APIs. <strong>We want people to use the AsyncAPI specification and tooling together with their existing OpenAPI, GraphQL, and gRPC definitions.</strong> For that purpose, our specification and tools will need to understand and leverage many other specifications and tools.
                  </p>
                  <p className="my-4 text-gray-600 lg:text-center">
                    This is not about reinventing the wheel or creating yet another spec to solve the same problems but to integrate with the existing tools and specs instead.

                  <p className="my-4 text-gray-600 lg:text-center">
                    We want to make the development experience super seamless, from idea to production. <strong>Users should be able to create their first API within minutes without prior knowledge of AsyncAPI, the communication protocol, or anything else that's not business logic.</strong>
                  </p>

                    We are aware that our goals are ambitious. <strong>None of the other goals are possible if we don't have a huge community supporting us. AsyncAPI is and must continue being a community-driven initiative. Now more than ever.</strong>

                    We need people to contribute code, ideas, docs, articles, presentations, and more. The sponsors base should also grow along with the community size and the donated money should serve to give back to the community.
