## About the team

Postman is the world’s leading API collaboration platform used by more than 15 million developers and 500,000 organizations worldwide. Postman was founded on a straightforward premise: to simplify each step of building an API so developers could create better APIs—faster.

Postman’s Open Technologies function was created to establish Postman as a leader in the API sector by investing in Open Specifications, Standards, Tooling, Data, and Policies as well as building strong relationships with thought leaders and organizations in the domain.

Through our collaboration with the AsyncAPI Initiative, we are looking for a Developer Advocate to work closely with the AsyncAPI team within our Open Technologies function to help shape and build the future of API tooling. Everything is open-source and, therefore, much of your work will be open-source too.

We believe that building a strong community and investing in their success is essential to our own success as a company. You will engage with open source communities on GitHub while collaborating within the AsyncAPI team to drive API better practices throughout the broader API ecosystem. In addition to advocacy, you will also have shared responsibilities for user education and community engagement.
