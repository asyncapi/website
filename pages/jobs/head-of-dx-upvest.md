## About the team
We are a bunch of builders who want to enable other builders to do great things by providing an awesome platform and API for them. We are low hierarchy, no bullshit, trust and transparency valuing group of people. We are looking for ownership taking and outcome focused leaders to join our Mission of democratizing access to investments.

## TL;DR
* :muscle: Own the Developer Experience of our Investment API Platform (OpenAPI/AsyncAPI)
* :house_with_garden: Head of roles need some travel to Berlin (a few times a month) so easiest for Germany-based candidates.
* :money_mouth_face: Market rate salaries but most importantly great options package and a chance to get in at early A-series valuation.

## About the job

We are an API-first company. Our product is an HTTPS/JSON API our clients integrate with to embed investing capabilities inside their own products. As such the public API is the face of the product and the company. We take a lot of pride in it. Developer Experience is one of the newest teams at Upvest but also one of the most crucial ones. This team owns our public-facing API specifications (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI). It is their job to align with internal Product Engineering teams on best practices and our ways of working with APIs (both public and internal). This team also is responsible for making sure all our documentation, tutorials and guidelines are as easy to understand and use as possible for our clients. They will also provide all the necessary tooling our clients need for making the integration easier including SDKs, command-line utilities, and things we may not have considered yet.

## About you

As our Head of Engineering, Developer Experience, you’ll join and take ownership of our Developer Experience team (together with Tech Lead Raphael Hüfner and API Engineer Mikhail Kochegarov). This is a Lead of Leads type role meaning that the direct reports are Tech Leads leading their teams. You will report directly to the CTO, Juha Ristolainen.

You will play a critical role in Upvest Engineering leadership by owning and being accountable for all things related to the public-facing side of our APIs like API-specifications, documentation, SDKs, etc. You will work closely with your stakeholders from Growth and Customer Success as well as directly with the CTO and the CPO in discovering and defining what kind of support we should provide our clients in using our APIs. You will own the roadmap and backlog for Developer Experience and the shorter-term delivery plans with your Tech Leads. You will also be accountable for delivering on those plans. We always put the customer first so leading by example you will set the standards to ensure our API-specifications, documentation, onboarding, and SDKs are all conforming to standards and world-class in ease of use and readability.

You will collaborate with your Head of Engineering peers in aligning on strategy and plans, agreeing on priorities as well as the growth of the organization.

You will be working on a greenfield project with cutting-edge technologies and no legacy code.
