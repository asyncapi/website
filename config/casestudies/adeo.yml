challenges: |
    Cost Component Repository product, part of the ADEO tech products, is used to calculate and publish transfer prices between different internal locations globally. Different business units use different information systems. It is hard to learn how each business unit shares information about its systems, API and accuracy.

    The initial solution was a developer portal with a list of all applications and reference to dedicated documentation. Some legacy systems had docs written in MS Excel.

    There was a need for a standart way of describing event-driven architecture.
solution: |
    The API is now described with AsyncAPI. The AsyncAPI file, stored with the source code, generates HTML documentation in the same release pipeline for the product. Documentation is exposed internally as part of the product for other company units depending on the API.

    Payloads are described with Avro schema. These schemas generate models and are referenced directly in AsyncAPI files thanks to the `schemaFormat` feature and `$ref`. This way, they make sure the code is aligned with the docs.

    Shift to using AsyncAPI also enables the team to implement more use cases using AsyncAPI files.
technical:
  languages:
    - Java
  frameworks:
    - Spring
  protocols:
    - Kafka
  brokers: |
    Kafka with Kafka Connect component. There are 15 production brokers with 47 topics. 
  testing: |
    For Kafka, e2e tests are done with [Zerocode](https://github.com/authorjapps/zerocode). Load tests are handled with [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) with the [kloadgen](https://github.com/corunet/kloadgen) plugin that supports Kafka and Avro.
  architecture: |
    The following [enterprise integration patterns](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging) are applied:
    - [Request/Reply](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/RequestReply.html)
      Described with `description` field in AsyncAPI. Reply goes to dedicated reply channel. Example description of response channel:
      ```
      description: >
      This topic is used to REPLY Costing Requests and is targeted by the
      `REPLY_TOPIC` header.
      ```
    - [Return Address](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/ReturnAddress.html)
      Info that needs to be provided by the client so producer knows where to send a response. Information is sent in the message header with the `REPLY_TOPIC` property. The AsyncAPI file documents information as part of the Message Header object. Example of request message header with `REPLY_TOPIC`:
      ```
      headers:
        type: object
        required:
          - REPLY_TOPIC
        properties:
          REPLY_TOPIC:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/ReplyTopic"
      ```
    - [Correlation Identifier](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/CorrelationIdentifier.html)
      This pattern enables the identification of the request given to the sent response. The `REQUEST_ID` property is in the request message header. The `CORRELATION_ID` property is in the response message header. Both headers are described in the AsyncAPI Message Header object and referred to in the AsyncAPI `correlationID` property.
      This means that correlation identifier is represented by different property in the message header, depending if it is a request or reply. Example of request message header with `REQUEST_ID`:
      ```
      headers:
        type: object
        required:
          - REQUEST_ID
        properties:
          REQUEST_ID:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/RequestId"
      ```
      Example of how `correlationId` points to `REQUEST_ID`:
      ```
      correlationId:
        description: >
          This correlation ID is used for message tracing and messages
          correlation.
          This correlation ID is generated at runtime based on the `REQUEST_ID`
          and sent to the RESPONSE message.
        location: $message.header#/REQUEST_ID
      ````
    - [DeadLetter Channel](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/DeadLetterChannel.html)
      Also known as Dead Letter Queue. In Kafka, it is just another channel where undelivered messages are sent. Not part of the AsyncAPI file, as API consumers will not listen to this channel. Consumers know what happens with wrong events.
    - [Invalid Message Channel](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/InvalidMessageChannel.html)
      Invalid messages are routed to the dedicated channel for rejected requests but are not part of the AsyncAPI file, as API consumers will not listen to this channel. Consumers know what happens with wrong events.

  codegen: |
    Java models generation. Avro schemas used as a source.
schemas:
  description: Avro 1.9
  storage: Git repository where source code is. During release they are published to Confluent Schema Registry.
  registry: Confluent Schema Registry.
  validation: Based on validation using Confluent Schema Registry.
  versioning: |
    Versioning is based on git tags. The schema version pushed to Confluent Schema Registry 
    matches the git tag version of the product. Every schema has a `version` information 
    that matches with product tag version.

    Example Avro schema with version information:
        ```json
        {
          "namespace": "com.adeo.casestudy.costingrequest",
          "type": "record",
          "name": "CostingRequestPayload",
          "version": "1.1.0",
          "fields": [ ... ]
        }
        ```
asyncapi:
  usecase: |
    Document the API of the product, so its users know how it works and how to use it. AsyncAPI was selected as the standard that allows you to generate documentation from a machine-readable document that describes the API.
    The goal was to document API in a standardized way, so other internal products could follow to unify how APIs are documented across the company.
  versions:
    - 3.0.0
  storage: Git repository where source code is.
  editing: IntelliJ without any special plugins. Sometimes people use AsyncAPI Studio, but not regularly because of lack of support for references to local drive.
  maintainers: Developers
  audience:
    internal: true
    external: false
  extensions: |
    Extensions are used to describe details about custom security:
    ```yml
      x-sasl.jaas.config: >-
        org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required
        username="<CLUSTER_API_KEY>" password="<CLUSTER_API_SECRET>";
      x-security.protocol: SASL_SSL
      x-ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm: https
      x-sasl.mechanism: PLAIN
    ````
  documentation: |
    Documentation generated from AsyncAPI is hosted as part of the product on a dedicated endpoint using Spring controller. 
    Publishing is part of the CI/CD pipeline for the product using GithubActions.

    Critical features of AsyncAPI related to documentation:
    - use of `version` parameter in the generator command to display the release version from the `Maven` pom 
    - `descriptions` that support `CommonMark` (Markdown) as they allow to put detailed structured descriptions and screenshots inside generated docs
    - examples and validation information. In this case converted from Avro to JSON Schema to show it in documentation and have examples generated
    - `Tags` for tagging operations to categorize them to make it easier to navigate in documentation UI
  bindings: |
      All Kafka bindings are used. Server, channel, operation and message bindings.
      
      Example of server bindings:
      ```
      bindings:
        kafka:
          schema.registry.url: >-
            https://schema-registry.prod.url/
      ```
      
      Example of channel bindings:
      ```
      bindings:
        kafka:
          replicas: 3
          partitions: 3
          cleanup.policy: delete
          retention.ms: 7 days
      ```

      Example of operation bindings:
      ```
      bindings:
        kafka:
          groupId:
            type: string
            description: >
              The groupId must be prefixed by your `svc` account, deliver by the
              Adeo Kafka team.
              This `svc` must have the write access to the topic.
          value.subject.name.strategy:
            type: string
            description: >
              We use the RecordNameStrategy to infer the messages schema.
              Use
              `value.subject.name.strategy=io.confluent.kafka.serializers.subject.RecordNameStrategy`
              in your producer configuration.
      ```

      Example of message bindings:
      ```
      bindings:
        kafka:
          key:
            $ref: "https://asyncapi.com/resources/casestudies/adeo/CostingResponseKey.avsc"
