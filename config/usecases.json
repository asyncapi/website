{"description":"All use cases related to AsyncAPI collectively contribute to most important aspect of software development, which is costs reduction. For example with \"Infrastructure as Code\" instead of enabling costly on-demand topic provisioning in your broker, you can automate it safely using AsyncAPI contracts. Before you provision new topics, you can first validate if it this is not causing duplicates and unnecessary costs increase. Use case like \"Governance and Consistency\" or \"Developer Portal\" significantly contributes to adoption of events infrastructure in consistent way and makes onboarding faster, that directly converts to cost reduction.","usecases":{"infraascode":{"title":"Infrastructure as Code","description":"This makes them a great fit for Infrastructure as Code.
