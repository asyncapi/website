## How to contribute to AsyncAPI Docs

Did you know that you can contribute Docs to AsyncAPI as well? Code isn't the only way to contribute to OSS; Dev Docs are a **huge** help that benefit the entire OSS ecosystem. At AsyncAPI, we value Doc contributions as much as every other type of contribution. ‚ù§Ô∏è

To get started as a Docs contributor:

1. Familiarize yourself with our [project's Contribution Guide](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

2. Head over to our Docs GH Board [here](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/projects/12).

3. Pick an issue you would like to contribute to and leave a comment introducing yourself. This is also the perfect place to leave any questions you may have on how to get started.

4. If there is no work done in that Docs issue yet, feel free to open a PR and get started!

### Talk to me

I want and need to listen üëÇüèΩ to all of your perspectives and ideas. Please don't be shy to express to me what you think needs to be documented first or what is missing. üìù There's a lot of good work ahead, but **you** determine _our content roadmap_ because the OSS community needs should always come first.‚ú®
