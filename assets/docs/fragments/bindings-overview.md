Bindings in AsyncAPI provide a way to add protocol-specific information to the AsyncAPI documentation. They can be added to different document parts, such as servers, channels, or messages; they specify standard details specific to a particular protocol. The purpose of bindings is to enhance the API's understanding and usage by providing additional context and configuration options for different protocols.
