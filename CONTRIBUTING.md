# Welcome to AsyncAPI

Welcome to our open-source project! We're excited to have you join our community and contribute to making our project better. Please follow this guide to ensure a smooth contribution process and maintain the quality of our codebase and documentation. 

We encourage all contributors to familiarize themselves with these guidelines and actively participate in the project's growth. If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to contact the project maintainers or community members.

## Code of Conduct

AsyncAPI has adopted a Code of Conduct (CoC) that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please [read the full CoC text](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to understand the expected behavior.

## Our Development Process

We use Github to host code, track issues, feature requests, and accept pull requests.

## Contribution flow

The following is a summary of the ideal contribution flow.

```
    ┌───────────────────────┐

    │   feature request)    │
    │                       │
    └───────────────────────┘

Issues and pull requests without activity from the creator within 14 days will be automatically closed by a triager or committer. However, closure does not mean rejection. If you wish to revisit a closed issue or pull a request, open a new one referencing the closed item.

Issues and pull requests without activity from the triager or committer within 14 days may occur for many reasons. The creator may use the `/ptal` comment in the pull request to call out maintainers.

### Issues

[Open an issue](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/issues/new) **only** if you want to report a bug or a feature. Don't open issues for questions or support; join our [AsyncAPI Slack workspace](https://www.asyncapi.com/slack-invite) and post your queries on the relevant channels. Don't forget to follow our [Slack Etiquette](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/slack-etiquette.md) while interacting with community members! It's more likely you'll get help, and much faster!

### Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Please use our issues templates, which provide hints on what information we need from you to help you out.

### Pull Requests

**Please open an issue before starting a Pull Request unless it's a typo or a really obvious error.** Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the specification. It may be rejected if no issue was created first to discuss the need for a pull request.

Get familiar with our document that explains the [Git workflow](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/git-workflow.md) used in our repositories.

## Conventional commits

Our repositories follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) specification.

Pull requests should have a title that follows the specification; otherwise, merging is blocked. If you are unfamiliar with the specification, ask maintainers to modify it. You can also use this cheatsheet if you want:

- `fix: ` prefix in the title indicates that the PR is a bug fix.
- `feat: ` prefix in the title indicates that the PR is a feature.
- `docs: ` prefix in the title indicates that the PR only relates to the documentation.
- `chore: ` prefix in the title indicates that the PR is only related to cleanup in the project.
- `test: ` prefix in the title indicates that the PR is only related to tests.
- `refactor: ` prefix in the title indicates that the PR is only related to refactoring.

A prefix that follows specification is not enough. Remember that the title must be clear and descriptive, using the [imperative mood](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative).

Happy contributing! :heart:

## License

When you submit changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 License](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to [contact the maintainers](https://www.asyncapi.com/slack-invite) if that's a concern.

## Contribution recognition

We use the [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/specification) specification to handle recognitions. Read the [`recognize contributors` document](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/recognize-contributors.md).

## Maintainers setup

To streamline project management and facilitate onboarding, the maintainer's setup includes two roles: `triager` and `committer`.

There are also two separate areas of responsibility: docs and code. A committer can be responsible for code only, and a triager can be responsible for docs only. A maintainer can hold all roles and participate in different areas.

We recognize that because of the project's size and complexity, areas of responsibility can also become more granular. For example, a committer can be responsible for docs, but only community docs or a committer can be responsible only for project design. Project maintainers assess and approve these exceptions.

### Triager

Triagers are responsible for labeling, commenting, and managing issues and pull requests.

- Triagers assess newly-opened issues and pull requests.
Responsibilities include labeling issues and pull requests, commenting, closing, and reopening items as needed, as well as assisting users and novice contributors.
- Triagers are crucial in enforcing the contributor guide and maintaining a clean backlog.
If a triager plans to become a committer, they should consult existing committers to gradually gain more rights. It's crucial to earn the trust of existing committers so they feel confident in your ability to merge PRs. A triager should consistently demonstrate dedication by regularly fulfilling their duties and actively reviewing PRs, providing code/docs suggestions and recommendations. This shows the committers that the triager is knowledgeable about the docs/codebase and committed to maintaining its quality.

### Committer

Committers are responsible for technical oversight, pull request approval, and onboarding of new maintainers.

- Committers approve pull requests and oversee the technical direction of the project.
- They are responsible for reviewing and approving pull requests for merging.
- Committers also play a role in onboarding new maintainers and triagers.
