# ✍How to publish a blog on AsyncAPI🗒️

We're super happy to see you want to publish on our blog. The AsyncAPI blog is open for everyone, any contribution is allowed, including reposting.
By posting an article on the AsyncAPI blog, you get many advantages. We'll ask on the community Slack to help promote it whenever it released.
We'll share it on the official AsyncAPI Twitter, LinkedIn, Hacker News, and Reddit. You can share your use cases, products, or tools in a form of a blog post to reach out to the entire AsyncAPI community.

**Following steps will walk you through on how you can submit your blogpost**

After raising the Issue from here [Submit Yours](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/issues/new?template=blog.md) you will get some reviews by the maintainers and then follow the below guide.

# Guide

- Fork the `website` repo from [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website)
- Add a new markdown file [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/tree/master/pages/blog) with proper metadata (front matter) and the article content, as other posts have. The content of the article is up to you, it just needs to mention "AsyncAPI"
- All images should be placed [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/tree/master/public/img/posts) into a folder that has the same name as the markdown file created a step before. Also, make sure to have the following:

> **Compress the image as much as possible, we recommend https://squoosh.app/
The output format needs to be `.webp`
Include a clear `alt` description for people that cannot see images**

- Run the website locally or with Gitpod by using [Instructions](https://github.com/asyncapi/website#usage) to test your changes.
- Open a PR with your blog post and test your changes with a preview of the site on Netlify.
- Maintainers will review the article (e.g. language, images) and potentially ask for improvements
- Once it gets merged it will be available live in production 🚀

**We encourage you to write a blog post and sharing it with the community. We can't wait to read it 😄!**
