excerpt: 'August Community Update'
---

The summer holidays are almost over, but the community hasn't slowed down. We've been receiving great news, and I'm thrilled to share that our list of sponsors is growing.

We're excited to welcome [HDI Global](https://www.hdi.global/) as our first end-user non-software vendor company as our Silver Sponsor. We're grateful to [Manuel Ottlik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelottlik) for helping us secure this sponsorship.

Additionally, we'd like to welcome [Route4Me](https://www.route4me.com/) as our Silver Sponsor for the initiative. We're thankful for their support.

Finally, we've received the transfers from [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). As promised, they've elevated their support from Gold to Platinum level and become a Platinum sponsor for the [AsyncAPI Conf on Tour](https://conference.asyncapi.com/). They've also allocated an extra $10,000 to further initiatives within the AsyncAPI ecosystem.

We're truly grateful for the support we're receiving to drive the vision and the initiative forward.


## AsyncAPI Conference's

We are excited that [our 2nd AsyncAPI Conference will be in London on September 18th](https://conference.asyncapi.com/venue/London). The event will feature a fantastic lineup of speakers and a jam-packed schedule. 
As promised, we have some free community tickets for the conference; [please visit the AsyncAPI Conference website and click the register button](https://conference.asyncapi.com/). 

**Note**: *When getting your tickets, please choose quantity one (1) of the Regular ticket and click the blue continue button to get your free ticket.*

If you are unable to attend our London conference, we will also be heading to the Paris conference on December 5th. [Our Call for Proposals is still open](https://conference.asyncapi.com/venue/Paris), and we encourage everyone to submit a proposal and share their expertise with the community. 


Additionally, [the Call for Proposals for our Online Conference is open](https://conference.asyncapi.com/venue/Online). Don't miss this opportunity to participate in and join us for this virtual event. 
The deadline for proposal submissions will be on the 20th of September.

## Spec x Tooling

### OpenAPI to AsyncAPI Converter
We love seeing the impact of the [AsyncAPI Bounty Program](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/projects/36/?pane=info) and how it solves community needs. One recently completed project introduced an OpenAPI 3.0 to AsyncAPI 3.0 convertor. The converter enables the easy transition of OpenAPI 3.0 documents to AsyncAPI v3. Thanks to [Mintu Gogoi's](https://github.com/Gmin2) effort and contribution, as well as [Jonas Lagoni](https://github.com/jonaslagoni), for reviewing, providing feedback, and providing guidance until the issue completion.

For more details about the converter, [please check the AsyncAPI converter readme](https://github.com/asyncapi/converter-js/blob/master/README.md#openapi-30-to-asyncapi-30-conversion).

### AsyncAPI Developer Network

The initial version of the [AsyncAPI Developer Network](https://asyncapi-developer-portal.netlify.app/) is out. Here, you can access all the details about the specification and its components, including bindings, schemes, and security. The main goal is to gather existing and new guidelines on the use cases of the AsyncAPI specification in one place. 
Kudos to [Pavel Bodiachevskii](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavel-bo/) for his outstanding work.

Be sure to visit the [AsyncAPI Developer Network portal](https://asyncapi-developer-portal.netlify.app/) for additional information.

### Kotlin-AsyncAPI
The donation for [Kotlin-AsyncAPI](https://github.com/asyncapi/kotlin-asyncapi) is complete, and the repository has successfully migrated under the AsyncAPI organization. Many thanks to [Lorenz Simon](https://github.com/lorenzsimon), and we are pleased to welcome him as a new AsyncAPI maintainer as well.

### AsyncAPI Maintainers List

Thanks to our bounty program and support from [Mateusz Szostok](https://github.com/mszostok), we're now maintaining the list of all AsyncAPI Maintainers in one place in an automated way. 
The functionality is based on GitHub feature called `CODEOWNERS`. Each repository contains such a file and is the truth source for us. The new automation keeps an eye on these files and updates [MAINTAINERS.yaml](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.yaml). In such a large organization, it is hard to follow all the changes in ownership of certain repositories manually.

Thanks to the automation, we also know that the current number of maintainers in the AsyncAPI Initiative isÂ **72**.

## AsyncAPI Mentorship Program
The planning for the 3rd cohort of the AsyncAPI Mentorship Program is already underway. In this edition, we prioritize projects that promote maintainership, meaning project ideas should align with our goals and pave the way for contributors to evolve into maintainers.

If you have an exciting project idea that should be part of the program, please share it in the [Mentorship Program 2024 discussion](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1361). If you want to participate as a mentor, [please read more in the AsyncAPI Call for Mentors discussion](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1350).

## Case Studies
We're thrilled to announce the publication of our second case study. The HDI Global brand provides life and property/casualty insurance services in Germany and internationally. They serve individuals and corporate clients and have offered industrial insurance since 2016.

For more in-depth information, [explore the HDI Case Study on our website](https://www.asyncapi.com/casestudies/hdiglobal).


## AsyncAPI Ambassador

We are pleased to welcome [Manuel Ottlik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelottlik), Product Owner of the Integration Platform at HDI Global SE, as our [AsyncAPI Ambassador](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/ambassadors/manuelottlik).
