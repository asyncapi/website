At AsyncAPI, we strive to provide valuable opportunities for individuals to work on open-source projects and gain real-world experience. 
We are excited to announce the fantastic projects that made it to the Google Summer of Code this year. Although we initially submitted five projects, only four got selected.

| --- | --- | --- |
[Automate listing of members of technical steering committee](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/issues/210) | [Lukasz Gornicki](https://github.com/derberg) | [Richa Sharma](https://github.com/14Richa) 
[Add "Autofix" feature for common linting errors (w/ spectral)](https://github.com/asyncapi/vs-asyncapi-preview/issues/160) | [Iván García Sainz-Aja](https://github.com/ivangsa) | [Savio Dias](https://github.com/Savio629)

We can't wait to see these talented individuals progress throughout the program.

## Spec x Tooling
The [Parser-JS v2](https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js) is finally released. You can browse the [Parser-JS documentation](https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js#api-documentation) and learn more! It supports the AsyncAPI schema and JSON schema formats. Additionally, the Parser-JS implements a global API definition for all AsyncAPI parser implementations and is browser compatible.

You can now reference AsyncAPI JSON Schema along with the SchemaStore project. This feature allows you to use JSON and YAML plugins in your IDE and fetches the JSON schema for your AsyncAPI document, providing you with autocompletion, validation, and tooltips. To ensure that the IDE recognizes your AsyncAPI document, SchemaStore matches the file names for the schema. For more details, [check out the SchemaStore](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore) or test the [AsyncAPI JSON Schema](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec-json-schemas) for yourself.

## AsyncAPI Mentorship Program
We are glad to have received a significant number of entries and are now moving to the next phase - ranking the projects in this year's cohort. Please stay updated by following the [AsyncAPI Mentorship discussion and timeline](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/689).
