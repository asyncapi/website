excerpt: 'End of startup period for AsyncAPI Initiative. We no longer need an Executive Director, as with such a strong community, we can set up a more resilient Governance Board'
---

May 2025 marks the end of the AsyncAPI Initiative’s startup phase. With a mature, engaged community, we are transitioning from a single Executive Director model to a resilient multi-member Governance Board. A quorum of two-thirds was needed to amend the charter. Seventy-eight percent (78%) of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) (32 out of 41) approved the new governance setup. Eight members did not vote, and one member abstained. You can learn more about the vote from [the pull request where we worked on the new governance setup for months](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/1634#issuecomment-2851246866).

**tl;dr:** Are you the TSC member? Want to join the AsyncAPI Governance Board? Send your name—or nominate someone—to **info@asyncapi.io**. However, I suggest you read further and learn about the recommended way of submitting a candidate’s name.

## Technical Steering Committee (TSC) Continuity

The TSC’s structure and decision-making process remain unchanged. It continues to be the body that votes on and steers the AsyncAPI Initiative’s technical direction and community evolution.

## Ambassadors Now Eligible for TSC Membership

Our Ambassadors have delivered high-quality educational content, promotional articles, and speaker engagements—without writing code or docs as maintainers typically do. Ambassadors also provide invaluable support at AsyncAPI Conferences. Ambassadors are as important as maintainers. Effective immediately, Ambassadors may now join the TSC.

## Governance Board Replaces Executive Director

We will replace the single Executive Director with a three-person Governance Board this year. We will expand to five members in 2026. This change significantly improves our resilience against the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor).

For details, see the updated [Charter](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/CHARTER.md) and [Governance Guide](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md).
