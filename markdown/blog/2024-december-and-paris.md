excerpt: 'November and December Community Update And Paris Conference Summary'
---
I can't believe we are in the final weeks of the year, and it has been an eventful one. As a community, we have experienced both proud and painful moments, celebrated our victories, and faced challenges and losses. However, in the end, we overcame those difficulties and emerged stronger and better.
 
Although this summary is a bit later than usual, I am excited to share the details of what happened in November and December and the highlights from the last conference of the year, which took place in Paris.

## AsyncAPI Community Building and Maintenance Goals Proposal 2025

The 2025 community building and maintenance goals proposal is currently open for discussion and will soon be put to a vote for TSC members. We would love your thoughts and suggestions, particularly when solving our community's challenges.
[Please take a moment to review the open PR related to the AsyncAPI Community Building Goals for 2025](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/1575) to participate in the discussion and share your ideas and solutions.

## AsyncAPI Conf in Paris 2024

The AsyncAPI Conf was back again in Paris this December, thanks to [Mehdi Medjaoui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdimedjaoui/) and the amazing team at [APIdays](https://www.apidays.global/) for hosting and sponsoring the venue. We participated in the three-day event, celebrating a year of the `API Standards` booth alongside friends from OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and GraphQL. Special thanks to all the members of the AsyncAPI community who could join the conference and help at the booth: [Hugo Guerrero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugoguerrero/), [Fran Méndez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fmvilas/), [Richard Coppen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-coppen/), [Hari Krishnan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harikrishnan83/), and [Lukasz Gornicki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukasz-gornicki-a621914/).

The AsyncAPI Conf track took place on the 3rd day of the conference, featuring an impressive lineup of sessions that attracted a diverse audience. The event was consistently packed, with attendees engaged throughout the day.

[Fran Méndez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fmvilas/) and [Lukasz Gornicki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukasz-gornicki-a621914/) started the track with a welcome speech and mentioned that AsyncAPI recently celebrated its 8th anniversary in November.

[Naresh Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nareshjain/) and [Pierre Gauthier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierre-gauthier-46080916/) presented their keynote on `TMForum's AsyncAPI for a New Era of Event-Driven Architecture`. During the session, Pierre announced TMForum adopts AsyncAPI as a standard, with over 120 telco APIs already in production. TMForum has around 800 telco companies, and they will implement all APIs in an async manner, extensively utilizing the request-reply pattern.

[Frank Kilcommins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-kilcommins) demonstrated how treating API governance as an enabler unlocks the ability to deliver compelling developer experiences for producers and consumers in event-driven architecture (EDA).

[Leonid Lukyanov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonid-lukyanov/) shared how EDAs introduce new data models, protocols, and APIs not found in the traditional REST/CRUD application stack. And how one can abstract these elements to make them feel familiar to application developers, allowing them to create streaming applications seamlessly.

[Hugo Guerrero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugoguerrero/) then shared how the AsyncAPI Initiative is not only in charge of the specification but has created open-source projects to make it easier for developers to work with the specification documents.

[Julien Testut](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julientestut/) and [Alessandro Cagnetti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cagnetti/) shared how organizations can harness the full potential of event-driven integration by leveraging GoldenGate Data Streams, AsyncAPI, and Solace PubSub+ Event Mesh. They shared a great use case for AI and how it can be trained real-time and standardized with AsyncAPI.

[Annegret Junker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-annegret-junker-141a99a4/) explained how to design effective asynchronous APIs by using an API-first approach. The importance of defining Kafka topics and structuring your definitions.

[Jonathan Michaux](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmcx/) spoke on how leveraging AI agents with AsyncAPI can create conversational interfaces that dynamically interact with event streams and asynchronous messaging systems.

[Hari Krishnan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harikrishnan83) and [Joel Rosario](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-c-rosario/) touched on leveraging the AsyncAPI specification as an executable contract and how to isolate and test each component within an EDA.

[Laurent Broudoux](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurentbroudoux/) and [Hugo Guerrero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugoguerrero/) ended the day by explaining how to use Microcks to provide a solution for mocking and contract-testing your async APIs without extensive coding and empowering you to build extensive and reliable integration tests.

## Final Remarks

It's been a privilege to write the AsyncAPI monthly summary blog consistently. As this is the final blog for the year, I am genuinely grateful for the opportunity to serve and continue supporting the community.

As we approach the holidays, I wish everyone happy holidays and a fantastic 2025. 

I'll be back next year with an overall review summary of 2024. 

**Until then, stay safe, and happy holidays!**
