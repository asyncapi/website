As the fourth quarter of the year begins, we enter a new season where we, as a community, reflect on the events of the year while also preparing for the year ahead. It has been a time of growth, but let's dive into the updates from September, including the AsyncAPI London conference, new case studies, and our preparations for the AsyncAPI Community Goals for 2026.

## AsyncAPI Conference 2025
We have hosted a track this month and also have upcoming ones, along with a few Calls for Speakers that are still open. Let’s get into the conference updates.

### AsyncAPI London Recap

We returned to London for the AsyncAPI track at the APIdays London conference. On the first day, we started with the API Standards booth, where our TSC members and maintainers together with OpenAPI and Arazzo.

On the second day, we held our AsyncAPI track. The track and booth would not have been possible without the support of [Dale Lane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalelane), [Daniel Kocot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielkocot), and [Ian Cooper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-cooper-2b059b), who volunteered, hosted, and ran the booth.

## AsyncAPI Community Building and Maintainance Goals 2026
It's time to start preparing for the Community Building and Goals for 2026. Before we dive into this, it's important to have a look at the few things that we've accomplished.

- We transitioned fully to the Maintainership Program, [and we are currently working on documentation and guides for it](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/1894).
- We have also completed onboarding docs and [published video content on YouTube](https://youtu.be/5Gaz2Q-CKqE?si=S8gy1v2DfCnMFkBv), with two more currently in progress under the Bounty Program.
- This year, we expanded our conferences, exploring new locations and having new partnerships.
- The AsyncAPI Bounty Program is celebrating 2 years of successful running and impacting the community.

These achievements wouldn't be possible without the community builders who are leading different initiatives. Now, it's your turn to participate in building and sustaining our community. Once the goals are finalized, please get involved!

[You can read about the 2025 community building goals to learn more on the approach we take](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/community/030-project-vision-strategy-goals/2025_Community_Goals).

## AsyncAPI Case Studies
We are excited to have our 3rd case study published from TransferGo, a company that operates in over 160 countries, providing international money transfer services with a focus on accessibility, speed, and affordability for migrants.
