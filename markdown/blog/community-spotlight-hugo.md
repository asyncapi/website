In this edition of our Community Spotlight, we’re excited to feature [Hugo Guerrero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugoguerrero/), a seasoned software developer, open source contributor, technical marketer, and advocate for better developer experience in the world of APIs and event-driven architecture. With over two decades of industry experience, Hugo brings both depth and clarity to AsyncAPI’s growing ecosystem. Currently the Head of Technical Marketing at [Kong Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/konghq/)

I had the pleasure of catching up with Hugo after the AsyncAPI track at APIDays Singapore, and we sat down for a more in-depth conversation on Hugo’s journey, his contributions, and what he sees on the horizon for AsyncAPI.

## Meet Hugo

**Bami: Tell us a bit about your background and how you first encountered AsyncAPI?**

***Hugo:** "My name is Hugo Guerrero. I'm from Mexico and currently based in Massachusetts, USA. I’ve been in software development since 1996 — over 25 years in roles ranging from developer to architect to consultant."*

Hugo's journey began with an electronic systems engineering background, but his passion for software development and architecture quickly led him into enterprise tooling, API management, and event-driven systems. His career spans both the **open source** and **enterprise software** worlds, and he’s currently focused on **Technical Marketing** and **Developer Advocacy**.

***Hugo:** “Technical marketing is all about bridging product capabilities with real developer needs, helping unblock them and showcasing how to use new features effectively.”*

## How Hugo Found AsyncAPI

While working on event-driven products and tools such as Kafka and JMS, Hugo came across AsyncAPI through the work of [Fran Mendez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fmvilas/) and the wider initiative. Around the same time, he was contributing to a CNCF project called [Microcks](https://github.com/microcks/microcks), which started to adopt AsyncAPI to better support various bindings like **Kafka** and **JMS**.

***Hugo:** I came across AsyncAPI a few years ago when I was exploring event-driven architectures. At the time, everyone knew OpenAPI for REST APIs, but there was a gap when it came to asynchronous communication. AsyncAPI filled that gap, and did it in a developer-friendly, open way.*

From early contributions on examples and specification discussions to supporting AsyncAPI within Micro and his enterprise tooling, Hugo's involvement has steadily deepened.

## From Curiosity to Contribution

**Bami: What drew you to AsyncAPI and event-driven architecture?**

***Hugo:** While working on enterprise architecture, I realized asynchronous communication, pub/sub patterns is essential to building scalable systems. AsyncAPI offered a structured, open way to document and support those patterns. It just clicked for me. I’ve always believed that tools should make developers' lives easier, and that’s exactly what AsyncAPI aims to do. I started by advocating for it in my talks and writing tutorials, but soon realized I could contribute more directly, especially by sharing feedback from the field and helping build awareness across the industry. It wasn’t just the technology though. The community was (and is!) incredibly open, diverse, and mission-driven. That really inspired me to get involved more deeply.*

**Bami: What’s been the most rewarding part of contributing to AsyncAPI?**

***Hugo:** Events. Getting to talk about AsyncAPI and seeing people realize the value it brings, especially its vendor-neutral nature is incredibly fulfilling. That moment of realization, where they see the possibilities, is the best.*

**Bami: Fantastic! Are there any AsyncAPI tools or initiatives you’re especially proud of?**

***Hugo:**  I love the specification, of course, but also the Playground, Editor, and Generators. These tools make the ecosystem practical and accessible, especially for new users trying to understand EDA.*

**Bami: What challenges have you faced with AsyncAPI?**

***Hugo:** The mindset shift from synchronous to asynchronous thinking can be tough. Terminology like "producer/consumer" or managing topics isn’t always intuitive. Also, support across languages and tools is still growing, and when it’s missing, you sometimes have to build your own.*

*But that’s also a call to action: more contributions help fill those gaps.*

## Advice to New Contributors

**Bami:  Amazing. Thank you so much. So, what advice would you give to someone just joining the AsyncAPI community as an OG in the industry?**

***Hugo:** First, network. Get to know people. Share ideas. Be polite and open-minded. You’ll find support and honest feedback. Also, start simple. Fix a doc. Share a config that worked. Suggest an idea. Don’t worry about making a huge splash on day one, just get involved and keep going.*

*Listen to what people are saying but don’t hesitate to contribute. Just be aware that it is an open community to share with, so it’s good to share but you will also get feedback on your ideas.*

**Bami: Okay, Okay. So, next is how can others get started contributing to AsyncAPI?**

***Hugo:** In open source and community work, the advice is often the same: start simple, start with what you know. If you notice issues in the documentation, fix them. If you’ve figured out how to make something work with your preferred framework or language, share that knowledge, because you're not the only one who’ll benefit. Your contributions—whether it’s configurations, specifications, or common pitfalls, can help many others.*

*And don’t underestimate the value of ideas. Share them. Some will gain traction, others might not, but putting them out there is a great way to get involved. Plus, the network you build along the way can open up even more opportunities.*

## Fun Fact: Between Commits and Curtains

**Bami: Amazing! Thank you so much. We are moving to the fun part now. What’s a fun or surprising fact about you that people may not know?**

***Hugo:** Back in high school, I was into musical theatre, singing, dancing, performing on stage! I don’t do it anymore, but it was a big part of my youth. A very different kind of spotlight! Obviously I was young and agile at the time, I’m not doing that anymore but that was fun.*

**Bami: Like “what color is the sky?”**

**Hugo: We were singing and dancing on the stage, so you can imagine.**

## Looking Ahead

**Bami: I can imagine. That must have been fun. Okay, so let’s move forward, what are you looking forward to in AsyncAPI’s future?**

***Hugo:** A robust, growing, and thriving ecosystem — where the specification is at the core, but the surrounding tools, contributors, and adopters bring it to life. hat’s what I expect for the future.*

***Bami: Awesome. Well put it there. Who should we spotlight next?**

***Hugo:** The ambassadors, the contributors, and the adopters. Their work, both behind the scenes and in the spotlight, is what keeps this community moving forward.*

**Bami: That's right, we have a lot of folks in the community who are working behind the scene, stay tuned for more community spotlight in the coming months. It’s been a pleasure chatting with you Hugo. Thank you so much for your time and all you do for the AsyncAPI community. I look forward to talking to you soon.**

## Conclusion

As we draw the curtain on this interview, it’s clear that Hugo Guerrero’s passion for improving developer experience, his advocacy for knowledge sharing, and his commitment to the AsyncAPI community are deeply rooted in years of hands-on experience and open source values. His journey reminds us that meaningful contributions often start with small, familiar steps, and that ideas, no matter how simple, have the power to shape communities and technologies.

Now serving on the AsyncAPI Governance Board, Hugo is not only influencing the future of the specification but also helping steer the community toward a more inclusive, collaborative, and developer-friendly ecosystem. We’re grateful for his continued contributions and excited to see what lies ahead with leaders like Hugo helping chart the course.
