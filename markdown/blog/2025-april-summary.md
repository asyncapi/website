We had a busy month, from having our first conference of the year, a new Platinum sponsor, to receiving 204 applications for Google Summer of Code (GSoC'25). Let's dive into the April update!

## New Sponsor
We are excited to welcome [Kong](https://konghq.com/) as our Platinum Sponsor!

We cannot thank our sponsors enough for their unwavering support. If you would like to get involved or support the project, [please check our sponsorship page on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/asyncapi) or email [info@asyncapi.io](mailto:info@asyncapi.io)


## AsyncAPI Governance Board
The vote to introduce the AsyncAPI Governance Board is now open. Part of the change will be replacing the Executive Director position. Additionally, Ambassadors will have the right to be part of the TSC. 

If you're part of the TSC, [please cast your vote on introducing the governance board discussion](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/1634#issuecomment-2822193087).

## AsyncAPI Conference

We had our first AsyncAPI Conference of the year in Singapore, and it was a great success. Thanks to our speakers for taking the time to come and share their knowledge. Be sure to read the Singapore summary once it is published.

### Call for Speakers
We are a few weeks away from closing the Call for Proposals for [AsyncAPI Conference in Munich](https://conference.asyncapi.com/venue/Munich) on the **11th of May** and [AsyncAPI Conference in Lagos](https://conference.asyncapi.com/venue/Lagos) on the **17th of May**. Please don't forget to submit those talks before the deadline ends; we look forward to you sharing your knowledge with the rest of the community!

While submitting your proposals, please select the "**AsyncAPI**" option for the track to ensure your submission goes to the correct category.

### Call for Sponsors
We are still open to financial sponsors for the AsyncAPI Conference 2025. [Please help us by sharing the conference prospectus within your networks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LxTFLWkRmFQkHOyrwZBL7yqSO2_XPJNq/view?usp=sharing).

## Spec x Tooling
[Godwin Alexander](https://github.com/oviecodes) recently opened a discussion about the future of [Glee](https://github.com/asyncapi/glee), noting that it is no longer being actively maintained. He is seeking input from the community on whether we should continue to invest in Glee. [Please share your thoughts in the Future of Glee discussion](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1861).

## Onboarding/Training Videos
As part of our community goals for this year, we aim to improve and streamline the onboarding process for new contributors. The collective effort is to ensure a smooth onboarding experience for AsyncAPI. We are excited that the first training video script is complete now under the AsyncAPI Bounty Program; you can watch the video on YouTube and give a like or a comment.

Our gratitude goes to [Barbaño González](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbano-gonzalez-moreno) and [Siham Tahi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siham-tahi) for their work on the training scripts and storyboards, and to [Azeez Elegbede](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acebuild) for recording the videos.

## Holopin Badges
It has been a year since we received the community Holopin badge license, and we have been working on designing our own custom AsyncAPI badges. I'm excited to announce that the badges are finally complete, thanks to the amazing work done by [Oloso Surur Olumide](https://github.com/Oloso-surur) under the mentorship of [Aishat Muibudeen](https://github.com/Mayaleeeee).

The next step is to upload the badges to the [AsyncAPI Holopin page](https://www.holopin.io/@asyncapi) and wait for platform approval before distributing them.

[You can find the details of the AsyncAPI Holopin Badges concept in the ReadMe](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/tree/master/design/Holopin-Badges).

## Google Summer of Code'25
GSoC'25 applications closed a few weeks ago, and we received 204 proposal applications this year compared to 77 from last year. 
Our mentors are now hard at work reviewing and grading the proposals, and we will soon welcome new contributors and future maintainers.
