We had a busy month, from having our first conference of the year, receiving 204 applications for Google Summer of Code (GSoC'25),  to some sponsorship updates. Let's dive into the April update!

## New Sponsors

We are excited to share that [Mercedes-Benz](https://opensource.mercedes-benz.com/manifesto/) is supporting the initiative as our Bronze sponsor and, most importantly, that they have officially confirmed they use AsyncAPI.

Additionally, [APIDeck](https://www.apideck.com/) has upgraded sponsorship to Bronze; a huge thank you to [Samir Amzani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amzani) for the support and effort.

## Sponsorship Updates
At the beginning of this year, [GitHub ](http://github.com/) sent us over $500 as part of their regular annual payment for the use of open-source projects. It is also confirmation that AsyncAPI is contributing to GitHub's development.

On another note, [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com) has terminated their sponsorship. They have changed their marketing strategy, resulting in a $100 decrease in our monthly budget for the Initiative. 
If anyone knows someone at RedHat who uses AsyncAPI and has a budget for support, please send me a message to [Lukasz Gornicki](https://asyncapi.slack.com/team/UD698Q5LM) or send an email to info@asyncapi.io. 

## AsyncAPI Governance Board 
The vote for the new AsyncAPI Governance Board is now open. Part of the change will be to replace the single Executive Director position and have the option of Ambassadors becoming TSC members. 

If you're part of the TSC, [please cast your vote on introducing the governance board discussion](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/1634#issuecomment-2822193087).

## AsyncAPI Conference

We had our first AsyncAPI Conference of the year in Singapore, and it was a great success. Thanks to our speakers for taking the time to come and share their knowledge. For a detailed summary, [please read the AsyncAPI Singapore Conference summary]().

## Spec x Tooling 
[Godwin Alexander](https://github.com/oviecodes) recently opened a discussion about the future of [Glee](https://github.com/asyncapi/glee), noting that it is no longer being actively maintained. He is seeking input from the community on whether we should continue to invest in Glee. P[lease share your thoughts in the Future of Glee discussion](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1861).

## Onboarding/Training Videos
As part of our community goals for this year, we aim to improve and streamline the onboarding process for new contributors. The collective effort is to ensure a smooth onboarding experience for AsyncAPI. We are excited that the first training video script is complete now under the AsyncAPI Bounty Program; [please watch it on YouTube and give a like or a comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcGhTALozzI).


Our gratitude goes to [Barbaño González](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbano-gonzalez-moreno) and [Siham Tahi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siham-tahi) for their work on the training scripts and storyboards, and to [Azeez Elegbede](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acebuild)for recording the videos.

## Holopin Badges
It has been a year since we received the community Holopin badge license, and we have been working on designing our own custom AsyncAPI badges. [I'm excited to announce that the badges are finally complete](), thanks to the amazing work done by [Oloso Surur Olumide](https://github.com/Oloso-surur) under the mentorship of [Aishat Muibudeen](https://github.com/Mayaleeeee). 

The next step is to upload the badges to the [AsyncAPI Holopin page](https://www.holopin.io/@asyncapi) and wait for platform approval before distributing them.

[You can find the details of the AsyncAPI Holopin Badges concept in the ReadMe](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/tree/master/design/Holopin-Badges).

## Google Summer of Code'25
GSoC'25 applications closed a few weeks ago, and we received 204 proposal applications this year compared to 77 from last year. 
Our mentors are now hard at work reviewing and grading the proposals, and we will soon welcome new contributors and future maintainers.
