In Q2, the AsyncAPI Marketing Working Group focused on expanding visibility, increasing engagement, and driving participation across our channels. With three major conferences in the pipeline—Singapore, Munich, and Lagos—our activities were centered around community outreach, event promotion, and contributor support.

This report outlines the key marketing activities executed, highlights performance metrics across platforms, and provides insights into what worked, what didn’t, and where we’re heading in Q3.

### LinkedIn Key Insight

This quarter, LinkedIn became our strongest growth engine, reflecting the success of our content strategy in driving professional engagement and industry visibility.

- Our follower base grew to 4,534 (+7%), adding 285 new followers despite a 7% dip compared to last month’s gains, a sign that while our growth pace slowed, audience quality remains high.

- With 78 posts published (+63%), we more than doubled our content output, leading to 48,443 impressions (+104%) and 3,007 clicks (+101%).

- The engagement rate reached 8.06% (+11%), showing that not only are we reaching more people, but our content resonates deeply with them.

Strategy alignment: Our push for thought leadership and value-driven content directly supported brand positioning as a trusted voice in the API and tech community.

**Twitter/X Performance** | **Value** | **Last Quarter Value** | **% Change** |
|:------------|:--------------|:-------------|:----------|
Tweets | 119  |  89  |  (+34%)  |
Retweets |  21  |  24  |  (-16%)  |
Impressions | 17,500 | 14,621 |  (+20%)  |

### X (Twitter) Key insight

X continues to be a space for timely updates and community conversations, though audience growth slowed this month.

- We published 119 tweets (+34%), which boosted impressions to 17,500 (+20%) and likes to 110 (+18%).

- Engagements (280, +1%) remained stable, while replies jumped by 67%, showing a stronger two-way conversation with the community.

- However, clicks dipped by 7% and new followers dropped by 25%, indicating that while interaction is happening, conversion to action and follower acquisition needs targeted focus.

Strategy alignment: The conversational engagement aligns with our community-first approach, but the drop in clicks and followers signals a need to balance interaction with calls-to-action and shareable content. Also we have decided to keep the automated tweets as they serve folks that are not on the Slack channel but still needs our spec and tools update.

### Website Performace

**User Engagement Insights (Google Analytics)**

**High Traffic, Low Engagement**

- "AsyncAPI Initiative for event-driven APIs" (17.3% of total views, avg. time 15s, 0.2% engagement)

  - This page draws the most visitors but fails to hold attention — very short dwell time suggests users either bounce quickly or don’t find the immediate content relevant.

- "3.0.0" (15.8% views, 38s avg. time, 4.9% engagement)

  - Strong traffic, better than above in engagement, but still relatively low for such a key spec release page. Visitors may be skimming rather than deeply reading.

**High Engagement, Lower Traffic** 

- "Understanding AsyncAPIs with a Practical Example" (3.1% views, 42s avg. time, 37.2% engagement)

  - Excellent retention rate — users are staying longer and interacting more. Suggests practical, example-driven content resonates.

  - Could be promoted more heavily to increase traffic.

- "2.6.0" (2.5% views, 55s avg. time, 36.5% engagement)

  - Longest dwell time and high engagement percentage, meaning readers are highly interested in detailed version-specific updates.

**Low Traffic, Moderate Engagement**

- "AsyncAPI document structure" (2.9% views, 46s avg. time, 5.0% engagement)

  - Decent retention but under-visited; likely valuable for users already in the documentation but not a strong entry point.

- "Generator" (2.9% views, 17s avg. time, 9.0% engagement)

  - Users interact, but short reading time suggests they find what they need quickly — could be a tool download or copy-paste scenario.

**Notable Drops**

- "Tools" (2.4% views, 15s avg. time, 2.4% engagement)

  - Both traffic and engagement are low — unclear value proposition or poor discoverability.

- "Usage" (2.0% views, 3s avg. time, 2.9% engagement)

  - Very low dwell time; possibly confusing, too short, or misplaced in navigation.

**Key Insights**

- Practical, example-driven pages ("Understanding AsyncAPIs…", version release notes) keep people engaged the most.

- High-traffic pages ("AsyncAPI Initiative…", "3.0.0") need clearer, more engaging intros or calls-to-action to reduce bounce rates.

- Hidden gems like "AsyncAPI document structure" could be surfaced more in navigation and promotions.

- Low dwell time pages suggest quick reference or unclear purpose may need restructuring.

## Event and Community Engagement 

### Slack Performace 



### The AsyncAPI Webinar Initiative

The AsyncAPI Webinar Initiative is a recurring, live, and on-demand knowledge-sharing program designed to educate, inspire, and engage the global AsyncAPI community. It serves as a bridge between technical contributors, industry adopters, and curious newcomers, offering a structured way to disseminate updates, best practices, and real-world use cases of event-driven APIs. We have some folks in the pipeline and the first session is set to happen in September as everyone will be on summer holiday in the most part of Q3. [The initiative documetation was merged in June](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/docs/070-marketing/webinar_series_initiative.md). 

Also, we took the libarty to create the [webinar planning template](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/docs/070-marketing/webinar_planning_template.md) that help us make sure we are on track with the planning and you can stay up-to-date with the webinar [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/1993).
