Happy 2026 to the AsyncAPI community!

Starting the new year by looking back at our community’s growth. Let’s review the numbers to see our progress, where we can do better, and how we can improve. These metrics help us understand our impact and guide us in the direction to take when working towards the community goals.

For the past achievements, [please read the previous Project Status updates](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog?tags=Project+Status).

> As a disclaimer, all analytics you’ll read here are collected from the 1st of January 2025 to the 30th of December 2025.

## Slack

The AsyncAPI Slack workspace is our primary channel for most communications and updates, where contributors and adopters join to collaborate with others, understand how we work as a community, and chat with maintainers of the specifications and tooling.

In 2025, we welcomed **1857** new joiners and have a total of **7964** members.

Our weekly activity reduced by 19% this year, with the intention of reducing noise in channels by disabling some workflow notifications and pausing certain channels. Also, we ran one mentorship program instead of multiple as we did in previous years, and had fewer active working groups.

## Social Media 
Our social media platforms help us to share community news, updates, and announcements. We don’t use any premium or paid marketing, and we only maintain LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Mastodon, and YouTube platforms. We use Buffer to publish and manage content across social media.

### Buffer
We began using Buffer in July 2024 and switched to paid services in September. This gave us more tools to track and report on our social media management. The analytics below cover LinkedIn and X/Twitter, which Buffer currently supports.

We also have some analytics recorded dating back to 2023.
