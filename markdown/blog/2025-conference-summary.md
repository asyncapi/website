Celebrating the third year of planning the in-person conferences brought growth this year. We rebranded to AsyncAPI Conference, doing away with the `On Tour` branding for a more unified brand while still keeping the same vision we had from the beginning. 

We expanded to six venues plus the online conference, and some worked better than others, but each taught us something valuable. We gained better knowledge, new case studies, stronger community bonds, and people connecting in person to share ideas.

Here’s how it went.

## Planning 
With the growing partnership we have with APIdays, we had the opportunity to run the AsyncAPI track at five venues, and API Conf Lagos hosted it in Lagos. The experience wouldn’t be complete without the Online Conference.

So in 2025, we were present in three new locations, expanding our reach, and had 41% of new speakers share their expertise at each conference, bringing the total to 39 speakers across all the events.
