excerpt: 'AsyncAPI Conference Summary for 2024'
---
As the saying goes, `"The second time is a charm."` AsyncAPI Conf on Tour returned in 2024 for a set of events across different locations. Not only did we run in-person conferences, but we also brought back our beloved online conference this time around, making the whole experience complete.

In the AsyncAPI Conf on Tour 2023, I mentioned a few things I would love to improve; let's see what we changed, the challenges we faced, and what we are changing as we advance.


## Planning Process
After a successful partnership with the APIdays Paris event, they offered to sponsor a track at other events they were hosting. Given the positive outcome in Paris, we were eager to explore the options. We decided to hold three in-person events with APIdays as our venue and host sponsor. 

Later in the year, I thought it would be a great idea to bring back the online conference to provide an opportunity for those who can't travel but still want to speak and share their expertise. This idea completed the entire experience, bringing the total number of events to four.

For a detailed summary of what happened at each event, please read the following summaries:

- [AsyncAPI Conference Helsinki](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/helsinki-and-community)
- [AsyncAPI Conference London](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/2024-september-summary-and-london)
- [AsyncAPI Online Conference](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/2024-october-summary)
- [AsyncAPI Conf in Paris](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/2024-december-and-paris)

## Challenges
The first challenge we faced was that most of the conferences were held in Europe this time, and for many, obtaining a Schengen visa isn't an easy process.

Secondly, although we have a venue and host sponsor, we still need financial support to cover costs such as shipping swags and providing travel funding for speakers.

## Attendance
We had an incredible turnout for all our in-person events. The highlight was networking with community members, ambassadors, and friends at the APIs Standards booth. This booth became a hub for discussions with various companies and experts while maintaining vendor neutrality.

Over **580** people attended our in-person conference, and we had more than **450** views during our AsyncAPI Online Conference livestream. Additionally, the recorded sessions received over **446** views after the conference.

You can also catch up on the [recordings from the AsyncAPI Online Conference](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbi1gRlP7pijItMBmw9SeeyWxuEa3jLR2&si=nFqLJrn50q4FNRIk).

## Conference Sponsors
AACoT'24 was possible thanks to [APIdays](https://www.apidays.global/), our Event Host and Sponsor. They not only provided a venue to host the conferences and sponsored us for lunch, breakfast, and refreshments, but we also had an `API Standards` booth.

I want to thank our financial sponsors, [Gravitee.io](https://www.gravitee.io/) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), for supporting the conference. Thanks to their sponsorship, I traveled to London to support the event in person. 
Additionally, we were able to provide partial assistance to speakers at the Paris conference and covered the logistics of swag shipment.

## Special Shout Out
Firstly, my gratitude goes out to all the speakers for dedicating their time to share their expertise and provide valuable insights to the community.

Secondly, I want to thank all the community members who volunteered at the API Standards booth during the conference. Your commitment to sharing knowledge with attendees is greatly appreciated and does not go unnoticed.

Lastly, I am genuinely thankful for their hard work and commitment to assisting me behind the scenes. They led and contributed to the aspects that made the conference successful and even being a courier so that we could have materials and set up the booth tables.
