October marked the third AsyncAPI Conference, this time an online edition. As someone fortunate enough to be extensively involved in organizing the conferences, I saw the challenges that came with in-person events. 
It gave me the idea to propose bringing back the online edition as part of the AsyncAPI Conference brand. We're glad and excited that we received positive results, with over **360 views** from attendees who watched and engaged with us.

I want to express my gratitude to our financial sponsors, [Gravitee.io](https://www.gravitee.io/) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), as well as to the speakers for their engaging talks and the conference volunteers (*be sure to check out the [Hall of Fame](#asyncapi-conference-hall-of-fame) section*). [I encourage you to watch the recorded sessions if you missed the event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGn8v0yBfOI&t=1895s). A playlist of the individual talks and slides will also be available on the [conference website](https://conference.asyncapi.com/).


## AsyncAPI Community Building and Maintenance Goals Proposal 2025
As we approach the end of 2024, we have a proposal outlining the community building and maintenance goals we should prioritize in 2025. Please note that the AsyncAPI community manager will manage and oversee these goals. The goals are poised to address some of the challenges our community is facing, such as the limited number of maintainers and the lack of onboarding materials, and pave the way for a more vibrant and thriving community.

I encourage everyone to participate in the open discussion and share your thoughts and solutions. [Please take a moment to review the open PR related to the AsyncAPI Community Building Goals for 2025](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/1575).

## AsyncAPI Conferences

### AsyncAPI Conf in Paris 2024
We are excited to announce that the final AsyncAPI Conference will be held on December 5th in Paris, thanks to the amazing team at APIdays. [The draft agenda is now available on our conference website](https://conference.asyncapi.com/venue/Paris), and the lineup of speakers looks fantastic.

Additionally, we have a limited number of free community tickets available. To register, please visit the [AsyncAPI Conference website](https://conference.asyncapi.com/).

**Note**:Â *When getting your tickets, please choose quantity one (1) of the Regular ticket and click the blue continue button to get your free ticket.*

### AsyncAPI Conf 2025 Venues
The discussion for potential venues for the AsyncAPI Conference 2025 is underway, and we invite everyone to participate. Please share your thoughts and suggestions for locations for the upcoming year in the [AsyncAPI Conference 2025 open discussion](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/1571). Your input is valuable to us!

### AsyncAPI Conference Rebranding
In 2023, we successfully launched the AsyncAPI Conf on Tour (AACoT). We followed our vision to host events in various locations, allowing us to connect with the community in multiple cities. As we expand our reach and grow as a brand, we believe it is necessary to drop "on Tour" and simply refer to our events as the AsyncAPI Conf/Conference moving forward. 
Although we are simplifying the name, we remain committed to hosting conferences worldwide and enhancing our conference brand's visibility. [We welcome your thoughts on this rebranding in the AsyncAPI Conf rebranding discussion](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1578).

### AsyncAPI at FOSDEM 2025

Are you attending FOSDEM and interested in speaking? AsyncAPI will participate in the FOSDEM conference as part of the `APIs: GraphQL, OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and Friends` track. 
[The Call for Participation is now open](https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2025/cfp), and we encourage everyone in the community to apply. Deadline for talk submissions is December 15, 2024. This is another great opportunity to meet fellow community members!

## Should AsyncAPI Initiative Endorse The United Nations Global Digital Compact?
The United Nations General Assembly has approved the Global Digital Compact, a commitment to ensure digital technologies support sustainable development and human rights. 
AsyncAPI is one of the key standards for event-driven architectures, and our Executive Director, [Lukasz Gornicki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukasz-gornicki-a621914), [has called for a vote](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/1577) to determine whether we, as the AsyncAPI Initiative, should endorse the Compact which aligns with our values of open-source software and collaboration. [We encourage all community members to participate in the vote and share their thoughts on this important decision](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/1577).

## Spec x Tooling
We're thrilled to announce that Glee has been migrated to a monorepo structure and is moving its core functionality to a new package called Gleequore, inspired by the Italian word "cuore," which means "heart." 
This change will allow developers to leverage Glee's features without using the full framework, facilitating integration with platforms like Remix and Next.js. 
We're also working on creating a "Glee for the browser" by extracting protocol adapters to support HTTP and WebSocket clients, overcoming current limitations. Kudos to [Fran Mendez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fmvilas) and all the Glee maintainers for their amazing work!

[The packages are now available on the Glee repo](https://github.com/asyncapi/glee/tree/master/packages); be sure to try it out.

## AsyncAPI Mascot Brand Refresh

As part of the AsyncAPI Bounty Program, we have a task to rebrand the Eve and Chan mascots. The designs look amazing so far!

## AsyncAPI Conference Hall of Fame
I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to the incredible volunteers who generously dedicated their skills and time to ensure the success of the Online Conference. From developers and designers to those working both on-stage and off-stage, their efforts made the planning and execution of the event seamless.
