It's been a very busy month in July as we had two conferences in two new cities, and we also had our first elected governance board members. It makes it exciting as we work together towards improving and investing in the growth and sustainability of the AsyncAPI Initiative.

But before we dive in, I want to acknowledge the continuous support we received from our sponsors in June.

## Sponsors
We are excited to share that the following sponsors have renewed their sponsorship and continue to support us:

[Gravitee](https://www.gravitee.io) as our Platinum sponsor for both the Initiative and the AsyncAPI Conference.

## Governance Board

We concluded our first [Governance Board](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/board) elections, and we are happy to welcome [Fran Méndez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fmvilas), [Thulisile Sibanda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/v-thulisile-sibanda), and [Hugo Guerrero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugoguerrero) as the first members.

Exciting times are ahead as we grow as a community.

## AsyncAPI Conference 2025
We had two amazing conferences in two new cities, one in Munich, Germany, and the other in Lagos, Nigeria. [APIdays](https://www.apidays.global) and [APIConf Lagos](https://apiconf.net) hosted us as part of the 2-day conference, and we also brought the API Standards Booth.

### Munich


### Lagos
For the 2-day event in Lagos, the AsyncAPI track took place on the first day with an amazing lineup of speakers from our community sharing their knowledge and work.

Maya started the track with her talk on how I Came to Design, I Ended Up Leading a Movement, sharing her journey from contributing as a designer to becoming a maintainer.

Prince followed with his session on Contributing to AsyncAPI from a Technical Writer's POV, where he spoke on the challenges he faced in contributing to AsyncAPI docs, how he overcame these challenges, and what he learnt.

Ace and Thulie shared a session on An Intro to AsyncAPI Without The Technical Jargon, how the Open Source community strives on collaboration, how we're growing and evolving, and Maintainership.

Later, Thulie spoke on The AsyncAPI Generator 101, where she provided an introduction to the generator tool, including how to define your AsyncAPI document and template before creating your desired documentation or code.

Ace closed the track by sharing on Preventing API Drift, strategies, and best practices.

#### API Standards Booth

JSON Schema joined us at the booth, and we had many interesting conversations. On the first day, people were eager to learn how two communities can come together to promote Open Source. There was curiosity in the atmosphere as attendees sought to understand how individuals with diverse skill sets collaborate and share their passion for the work being done in the AsyncAPI community.

Day two was even more vibrant. After the track presentations, many attendees had questions and were inspired by the topics discussed. Our maintainers and volunteers did an outstanding job of educating others and answering questions about the community, the specification, and the associated tooling.

I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to attend the conference and for volunteering at the API Standards Booth.
