It's been a very busy month in July as we had two conferences in two new cities, and we also had our first elected governance board members. It makes it exciting as we work together towards improving and investing in the growth and sustainability of the AsyncAPI Initiative.

But before we dive in, I want to acknowledge the continuous support we received from our sponsors in June.

## Sponsors
We are excited to share that the following sponsors have renewed their sponsorship and continue to support us:

[Gravitee](https://www.gravitee.io) as our Platinum sponsor for both the Initiative and the AsyncAPI Conference.

## Governance Board

We concluded our first [Governance Board](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/board) elections, and we are happy to welcome [Fran Méndez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fmvilas), [Thulisile Sibanda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/v-thulisile-sibanda), and [Hugo Guerrero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugoguerrero) as the first members.

Exciting times are ahead as we grow as a community.

## AsyncAPI Conference 2025
We had two amazing conferences in two new cities, one in Munich, Germany, and the other in Lagos, Nigeria. [APIdays](https://www.apidays.global) and [APIConf Lagos](https://apiconf.net) hosted us as part of the 2-day conference, and we also brought the API Standards Booth.

### Munich

We had a 2-day event in Munich, Germany. The most important thing we learned is that AsyncAPI is used in production by insurance giant Allianz, and that the whole event-driven topology at retailers like Lidl and Kaufland (under Schwarz Group) is managed with AsyncAPI.

The first day, what became our tradition, we started with the booth, where we could provide vendor-neutral consulting for the API community. The booth was there under the name `API Standards` with people not only from AsyncAPI but also JSON Schema, OpenAPI, and Arazzo. In case you want to learn more about the booth, how we organize it, and where, join the [API Standards mailing group](https://groups.io/g/api-standards).

The second day, we had an AsyncAPI track with four amazing presentations. The below short recap will nicely summarize how great it was.

### Lagos
For the 2-day event in Lagos, the AsyncAPI track took place on the first day with an amazing lineup of speakers from our community sharing their knowledge and work.

Maya started the track with her talk on how I Came to Design, I Ended Up Leading a Movement, sharing her journey from contributing as a designer to becoming a maintainer.

Prince followed with his session on Contributing to AsyncAPI from a Technical Writer's POV, where he spoke on the challenges he faced in contributing to AsyncAPI docs, how he overcame these challenges, and what he learnt.

Ace and Thulie shared a session on An Intro to AsyncAPI Without The Technical Jargon, how the Open Source community strives on collaboration, how we're growing and evolving, and Maintainership.

Later, Thulie spoke on The AsyncAPI Generator 101, where she provided an introduction to the generator tool, including how to define your AsyncAPI document and template before creating your desired documentation or code.

Ace closed the track by sharing on Preventing API Drift, strategies, and best practices.

#### API Standards Booth

JSON Schema joined us at the booth, and we had many interesting conversations. On the first day, people were eager to learn how two communities can come together to promote Open Source. There was curiosity in the atmosphere as attendees sought to understand how individuals with diverse skill sets collaborate and share their passion for the work being done in the AsyncAPI community.

Day two was even more vibrant. After the track presentations, many attendees had questions and were inspired by the topics discussed. Our maintainers and volunteers did an outstanding job of educating others and answering questions about the community, the specification, and the associated tooling.

I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to attend the conference and for volunteering at the API Standards Booth.

### Call for Speakers

We still have the Call for Proposals open for the [AsyncAPI Online Conference](https://conference.asyncapi.com/venue/Online) until the **7th of September**, the [AsyncAPI Conference in Paris](https://conference.asyncapi.com/venue/Paris) until the **5th of October**, and the [AsyncAPI Conference at DeveloperWeek 2026](https://conference.asyncapi.com/venue/California), **until the 7th of November**.

Please don't forget to submit those talks before the deadline ends; we look forward to you sharing your knowledge with the rest of the community!

## Spec x Tooling

[Pavel Bodiachevskii](https://github.com/Pakisan) has been working on compiling [AsyncAPI JVM tools under one website](https://asyncapi.pavelon.dev/). He has created the [AsyncAPI Developer Network](https://asyncapi.pavelon.dev), a place where you can find information about the AsyncAPI specification and its components. 

If you're using any tool or plan to use them, please share your feedback.

## Community Discussions
We have some various community discussions that need your input and community-wide insights. Please do get involved and share your thoughts.

### AsyncAPI Conference 2026
Since we have our first conference for 2026 confirmed and happening on the 18th - 20th of February 2026, it's also time to start the conversations on how we can improve the experience. 

[Please share your thoughts on how we can do better in the AsyncAPI Conference 2026 discussion](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/2015).

### AsyncAPI Meetups Section
As part of growing the AsyncAPI Conference brand and expanding our reach, the meetups' goal is to be in more locations beyond the main conferences, where people can come together and share their experiences using AsyncAPI and being part of the community.

Currently, we are in the phase of designing and implementing the page on the conference website. [Shriya Chauhan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shriya-chauhan-%F0%9F%A6%8B-20a19b200/) has been working hard on this for months.

Please join the discussion and [share your feedback on the Figma designs](https://www.figma.com/design/DlxWIrjez1bhmIIK4VO5Kb/AsyncAPI-Conf-2025--Copy-?node-id=5802-10942&p=f) and the [AsyncAPI Meetups implementation](https://github.com/asyncapi/conference-website/discussions/604).

### Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest season is coming up soon. If you're a maintainer at AsyncAPI and would love to participate, please join the pre-discussion happening on `#wg-community` on how to make the experience better and share best practices on how we can prepare for new contributors coming in through the program.


### Registration Platforms

We are looking for platforms that can help us collect data and build a database for all our attendees at the AsyncAPI Conferences, Meetups, and Webinars. The data collected will be used to understand the number of people interested in AsyncAPI, as well as something to present for sponsorships.

If you have any insights on the best platforms or other solutions we can use, [please share your thoughts on the Registration Platforms Research discussion](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/1994).
