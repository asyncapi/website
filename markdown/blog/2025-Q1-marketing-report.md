### X Key Insights

Tweet output dipped by 44%, leading to a -46% impression dip.
Replies saw a 75% increase, but overall reply numbers remain low.
The number of new followers rose by +239%, given the dip and loss of followers in the previous quarter. 

Overall, the decline in some metrics can be attributed to the higher number of events in the previous quarter, which naturally led to more content and activity than this quieter quarter.

### Website Performance

  className="text-center"
/>

**User Engagement Insights (Google Analytics)**
**Homepage Performance**

The main landing page, "AsyncAPI Initiative for event-driven APIs," received the highest traffic (17.3% of total views) but saw relatively low average time on page (17s), suggesting users may be skimming or using it as a jumping-off point.

**Strong Interest in Version 3.0.0**

The "3.0.0" documentation page held 16.6% of the total views with a solid 41s average time, showing deep interest in the newest spec release.

**High Engagement Pages**

"AsyncAPI document structure" and "Payload schema" had fewer visits but strong time-on-page (44s and 36s, respectively), indicating users are spending time understanding these technical sections.

Similarly, "Understanding AsyncAPIs with a Practical Example" drew good engagement (28s avg.) and "Coming from OpenAPI" shows decent dwell time (30s), making them great learning pathway pages.

**Notable Drops**

"Generator" and "Tools" saw good traffic but experienced drops in average time spent (-13.4% and +1.9%, respectively). This might mean users donâ€™t find these pages as intuitive or relevant and could benefit from clearer CTAs or improved content structure.

## Overview of the Marketing Strategy

 As highlighted in the [2024 Marketing Report](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/2024-marketing-report), the AsyncAPI Marketing Strategy was created to guide the community's marketing efforts in a focused and impactful way. On April 1st, 2025, the updated strategy document was officially merged and is now set for implementation.

Over the next few months, we will begin rolling out initiatives aligned with the strategy, and our progress will be tracked through clearly defined KPIs, and consistent quarterly reports will be shared to ensure transparency and accountability.

## Event & Community Engagement

### Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Mentorship Program

- AsyncAPI has successfully joined Google Summer of Code 2025, providing mentorship opportunities to aspiring open-source contributors.
- [A dedicated informational webinar was held on March 14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7pl1F2dYLo), led by our GSoC Program Coordinator, Elegbede (Ace) Azeez, to guide potential mentees.
- Outcome: Increased awareness and participation in the AsyncAPI open-source ecosystem.

### Community Spotlight Initiative

This quarter, AsyncAPI launched the Community Spotlight Initiative to recognize outstanding contributors.
The initiative highlights individuals making significant contributions to AsyncAPI, whether through code, documentation, advocacy, or community building.
We published the first blog [Ashmit story](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/community-spotlight-ashmit). This would be a monthly blog. [Find the community spotlight discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/1732)

### AsyncAPI Conference 2025

### Impact & Next Steps

- Increased community participation and AsyncAPI visibility have been clear indicators of the positive impact of our recent efforts.

- Our first live session, featuring Eduardo Maldonado Fonseca Silva, marked the beginning of our "Monthly Webinar series: Learn With AsyncAPI" â€” an initiative designed to create accessible, developer-focused conversations around AsyncAPI concepts, tools, and real-world applications. Eduardo shared deep insights into event-driven architectures and how AsyncAPI boosts interoperability in modern systems. The session covered best practices, practical use cases, and how to get started with AsyncAPI. It concluded with an engaging Q&A where the community posed thoughtful, implementation-focused questions.

- To sustain and scale this initiative, we plan to:

  - Host monthly live sessions and developer Q&As featuring maintainers, contributors, and experts in the ecosystem.

  - Introduce community-driven topic nominations to ensure the sessions address current challenges and interests.

  - Repurpose session content into bite-sized clips, blog posts, and social media highlights for ongoing engagement.

  - Build a resource hub where past sessions and learning materials can be accessed anytime.

  - Collaborate with community ambassadors and contributors to co-host sessions, fostering ownership and inclusiveness.
