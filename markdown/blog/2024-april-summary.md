We are excited and commend [Specmatic](https://specmatic.in/) for their commitment to supporting open-source projects. They have sponsored [Pavel Bodiachevskii](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavel-bo/), whose project assists in parsing AsyncAPI specs in Java and converting the parsed specs into executable contracts using the `jasyncapi` library. This kind of support is truly invaluable to the community and open-source maintainers. Please [check out the latest `jasyncapi` release](https://github.com/asyncapi/jasyncapi/releases/tag/1.0.0-RC) for more details.

## AsyncAPI Conf on Tour

We are thrilled to announce that AACoT'24 will return to London this year, and [the Call for Speakers is now open](https://conference.asyncapi.com/venue/London). Start preparing your proposals today, and get ready to join us in September!

On an exciting note, we're considering having an online edition sometime this year; [please attend the upcoming community meeting](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/1184) for more context.


## Spec X Tooling
The [AsyncAPI Optimizer](https://github.com/asyncapi/optimizer) has reached v1.0 thanks to the collaborative efforts of [Viacheslav Turovskyi](https://github.com/aeworxet), who has joined as the new maintainer. For breaking changes, [check out the release notes](https://github.com/asyncapi/optimizer/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

[Aklivity](https://www.aklivity.io/), one of the initiative sponsors, is developing Zilla, a multi-protocol service proxy for Kafka that now supports AsyncAPI v3 for configuration and validation. Please [read the announcement blog](https://www.aklivity.io/post/announcing-openapi-and-asyncapi-support-in-zilla) for more technical details and explore [the Zilla Petstore Kafka API v2 docs](https://tinyurl.com/zilla-petstore-kafka-v2) or [Petstore app demo](https://github.com/aklivity/zilla-demos/blob/main/petstore/README.md).

In our efforts to improve the contributor experience, we have introduced new help commands: **/ptal**, which pings reviewers to please take a look at the PR, and **/update**, which triggers the AsyncAPI bot to update a PR to the latest upstream. We are grateful to [Priyansh Mehta](https://github.com/Priyansh61), [Khuda Dad Nomani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khudadadnomani), and [Ashish Padhy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashish-padhy3023) for their contributions.

Don't worry if you don't remember all these commands; you can always use the **/help** command in a pull request, and the AsyncAPI bot will share a list of available commands.

## Community Discussions
Below are some community discussions that require attention.

### Marketing
After some weeks of discussing the marketing efforts, we are now looking for someone to fill the role of **Community Marketing Specialist**.

## TSC x Ambassadors
We're thrilled to announce a new automated TSC voting system! We want to thank [Aayush Saini](https://github.com/AayushSaini101) for working on the implementation, as this will make the voting process smoother, more efficient, and more transparent. With this new system, we hope to encourage greater participation and engagement. Please make sure to [read the voting docs](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/voting.md) to familiarize yourself with the new voting system.
