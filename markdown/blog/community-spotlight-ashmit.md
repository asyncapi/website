Open-source contributions have long been a gateway for developers to refine their skills, build meaningful projects, and connect with a global community. For many, the journey starts with small contributions, but for some, it evolves into a leadership role that impacts the project’s future. One such inspiring story is that of [Ashmit Jagtap](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashmit-jagtap/), whose path from a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) mentee to a maintainer within AsyncAPI showcases dedication, learning, and a deep commitment to open-source development. In this blog post, we explore his journey, challenges, and the lessons he learned.

## The GSoC Experience: A Transformative Phase

Ashmit’s open-source journey began with his participation in GSoC, an esteemed program that connects aspiring developers with organizations working on impactful projects. His interest in API documentation and event-driven architectures fueled his decision to contribute to the AsyncAPI Initiative. As a mentee, he worked on refining the AsyncAPI Conference website, and he was mentored by experienced contributors who provided guidance, code reviews, and architectural insights.

Reflecting on his GSoC experience, Ashmit emphasizes the steep learning curve and the importance of proactive engagement. He recalls, “Initially, I was overwhelmed by the scale of the project, but the community was incredibly supportive. I learned how to navigate large codebases, enhance my problem-solving skills, and contribute in a structured manner.” This phase allowed him to grasp not only the technical aspects of the project but also the collaborative spirit of open-source communities.

We then asked Ashmit about his GSoC experience with the AsyncAPI Initiative. Below, I've included an outline of our conversation.

## Getting Started with Google Summer of Code and AsyncAPI

**Bami: What inspired you to apply for Google Summer of Code with AsyncAPI?**

***Ashmit:** Google Summer of Code had been a goal of mine since my first year of college when I first learned about it. However, I knew it was a competitive program, so I focused on building my skills. I was ready to contribute by my second year and began working towards it in January. Initially, I aimed to contribute to Postman, but my contributions to both projects led to my selection for AsyncAPI.*

**Bami: How did you first learn about AsyncAPI, and what motivated you to contribute to the community?**

***Ashmit:** I discovered AsyncAPI while exploring Postman’s GSoC issues. The event-driven architecture and the mission of promoting open-source software intrigued me. My first significant interaction was with the VS Code extension for AsyncAPI, which allows users to preview YAML files. Later, I explored AsyncAPI React and the CLI tool. However, my primary project was the conference website, the most active repository due to an upcoming event.*

## The Project: Revamping the AsyncAPI Conference Website

**Bami: Can you tell us about your project, the problem it solved, and why was it important?**

***Ashmit:** The primary goal of my project was to make maintaining the conference website easier. Previously, the website had to be rebuilt or heavily refactored yearly due to a lack of a consistent theme or streamlined process, creating a significant workload for maintainers. My project aimed to standardize the codebase, making it easier to update and maintain. Additionally, I introduced automated testing to simplify reviewing contributions, ensuring that new changes wouldn’t break existing functionality.*

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

**Bami: What was the most challenging part of your project, and how did you overcome it?**

***Ashmit:** The most unexpected challenge occurred towards the end of the program when my project wouldn’t build successfully just before the final submission deadline. After deliberation, we merged the pull request and troubleshot the issue later. Unfortunately, this action caused the website to crash temporarily. My mentors and I worked intensively for a few hours to restore the website's functionality. It was stressful, but it reinforced the importance of testing and careful deployment.*

**Bami: What technologies and skills did you use for your project? Did you have to learn anything new?**

***Ashmit:** My project primarily used JavaScript, focusing on Next.js for the front end. For testing, I used Cypress for end-to-end testing. While I didn’t learn a completely new programming language during GSoC, I did have to learn TypeScript during the proposal phase and improve my understanding of testing methodologies.*

## Community Experience and Mentorship

**Bami: How was your experience with the AsyncAPI community and your mentors?**

***Ashmit:** My mentors, [Aishat Muibudeen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aishatmuibudeen/), [Thulisile Sibanda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/v-thulisile-sibanda/), and [Elegbede Azeez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acebuild/), were incredibly supportive. I’ve been involved with AsyncAPI for nearly a year and have been a maintainer for about five months. The community is hardworking, collaborative, and always looking to improve the project. The mentorship aspect was especially valuable in helping me balance my college studies with my GSoC responsibilities. My mentors were understanding and even took on tasks when I was unavailable.*

**Bami: Did you face any unexpected challenges or surprises during the program?**

***Ashmit:** Everything went smoothly apart from the final submission issue. However, the most unexpected challenge was adapting to remote collaboration. Before GSoC, I wasn’t very experienced with remote work. The program helped me develop asynchronous communication and project management skills, which are crucial in open-source and professional environments.*

## Key Takeaways and Advice for Future GSoC Mentees

**Bami: What were your key takeaways from the GSoC experience?**

***Ashmit:** One of my biggest takeaways was that anything is achievable with hard work and patience. Initially, I doubted my chances of being selected, but I put in the effort and succeeded. Another key lesson was the importance of structured workflows in open-source projects, which significantly improves maintainability.*

**Bami: Has this experience changed your perception of open-source? Was this your first time contributing?**

***Ashmit:** No, this wasn’t my first open-source experience. I previously participated in Hacktoberfest 2021 when they still gave out T-shirts! However, being a GSoC mentee and later a maintainer was a different experience. As a mentee, you focus on individual contributions, whereas as a maintainer, you oversee multiple contributions and ensure the stability of the project. It gave me a deeper appreciation of the responsibilities maintainers handle.*

**Bami: Any advice for future GSoC mentees or newcomers to AsyncAPI?**

***Ashmit:** I have two main pieces of advice: be patient and work hard. Open-source is community-driven, and maintainers often have full-time jobs, so responses to contributions can take time. Patience is essential. Hard work is equally important—keep learning, refining your skills, and making meaningful contributions.*

## Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Ashmit?

**Bami: What are your plans after GSoC? Will you continue contributing to AsyncAPI or explore other open-source projects?**

***Ashmit:** I am currently focusing on completing my degree and securing a position in a good software company. However, I will continue contributing to open-source because it has given me so much, and I feel a responsibility to give back. While AsyncAPI remains my primary focus, I am also interested in projects like Chromium, though I know it’s quite a challenging one to take on.*

**Bami: Are there any new features or improvements you’d like to see in AsyncAPI?**

***Ashmit:** Specifically for the conference website, I have some ideas for future improvements. However, AsyncAPI is constantly evolving, and I look forward to contributing to its growth and helping the community in any way I can.*

To add a bit of fun to our spotlight interview, we played a ***This or That*** game with Ashmit.

**Bami: Okay, so I have a fun activity to do with you. It is called this for that. So GitHub or GitLab.**

***Ashmit:** GitHub*

**Bami: Slack or Discord.**

***Ashmit:** Discord*

**Bami: LinkedIn or Twitter?**

***Ashmit:** Neither. I deleted both of them just this week. Yeah, both are toxic in their own ways, to be honest.*

**Bami: Google Docs or Microsoft Word.**

***Ashmit:** Google Docs.*

**Bami VS Code or Xcode**

***Ashmit:** Vs Code*

**Bami: Window or Linux**

***Ashmit:** Linux. Not hardcore Linux, like Fedora though.*

**Bami: Apple or Samsung.**

***Ashmit:** Samsung*

**Bami: How do you like to spend your time outside coding? Do you have any hobbies or interests?**

***Ashmit:** I might say cooking is one of them for hobbies. Yeah, I do enjoy cooking sometimes because when I have some spare time, that's where I go, towards the kitchen.*

**Bami: Is there anyone or a lot of people you would like to thank or give a shout-out to from the community or the GSoC program, either your other mentees, your mentors, or other community members.**

***Ashmit:** The mentors I would like to shout out are [Aishat Muibudeen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aishatmuibudeen/), [Thulisile Sibanda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/v-thulisile-sibanda/), and [Elegbede Azeez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acebuild/). And on top of that, I would like to thank [Lukasz Gornicki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukasz-gornicki-a621914/) for being quite helpful. Some issues in my project required his assistance, and he was there for them. That's nice of him because he didn't have to do it.*

For those considering GSoC or open-source contributions, Ashmit advises, *“Start with issues labeled ‘good first issue,’ ask questions, and don’t be afraid to make mistakes. Open-source communities thrive on collaboration and learning together.”*
