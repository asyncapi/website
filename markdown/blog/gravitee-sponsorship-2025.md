We’re happy to have Gravitee return as a platinum sponsor for both the AsyncAPI community and the AsyncAPI Conferences in 2025! Their renewed partnership is not only a show of continued support but also a reflection of their belief in the power of open standards, community-driven innovation, and modern API ecosystems.
Gravitee has long been part of AsyncAPI’s journey, not just as a sponsor but as an adopter, contributor, and champion of event-driven architectures (EDAs) that are secure, discoverable, and truly developer-first.

## A Shared Vision: Open Collaboration, Stronger Infrastructure

AsyncAPI’s mission is to make working with event-driven systems as seamless as it is working with REST. That mission only becomes a reality when organizations across industries join forces to push it forward sharing knowledge, building tooling, contributing to the spec, and supporting our diverse global community.
Gravitee’s sponsorship is rooted in this shared vision. They understand that success in the API economy depends not only on robust tooling but on shared specifications and interoperable ecosystems. That’s why Gravitee has made AsyncAPI an essential part of its architecture, empowering teams to define, document, and govern their asynchronous APIs just as easily as their REST endpoints.

## More Than Sponsorship: Investing in Community-Driven Growth

Gravitee’s renewed platinum sponsorship isn’t just a logo on a banner, it’s a commitment to sustainable, community-first growth. In 2024, their support helped us organize inclusive, impactful gatherings like AsyncAPI Conf Online and the Conference on Tour series now branded as the AsyncAPI Conference.
In 2025, their contribution helps us go even bigger, with in-person conferences in Lagos, Munich, Bangalore, London, Paris, and Online each designed to bring the AsyncAPI community closer together across regions and time zones. Gravitee’s support enables:

- Operational and travel cost for events.
- Broader outreach and visibility in growing the AsyncAPI communities around the world.
- Resources for speakers and panelists from diverse backgrounds.

When we say Gravitee is helping us “hold nothing back,” we mean it, they’re helping build an ecosystem where everyone can contribute, learn, and grow, no matter their location or technical background.

## Gravitee + AsyncAPI: A Real-World Use Case

Behind Gravitee’s sponsorship is a real, practical investment in using the AsyncAPI specification to build and manage asynchronous APIs. Gravitee enables organizations to work seamlessly across protocols like [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/), and [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) using the AsyncAPI spec as a foundation for documentation, governance, and developer experience. This approach strengthens discoverability and observability across distributed systems, making Gravitee a natural ally in advancing AsyncAPI’s mission and ecosystem.

By adopting AsyncAPI, Gravitee:

- Enables better **discoverability** of event-driven APIs
- Enforces consistent **governance** across async interfaces
- Improves **observability** for systems using asynchronous messaging
- Reduces the **complexity** of managing hybrid architectures (REST + async)
This real-world usage supports AsyncAPI’s vision of making event-driven APIs easier to design, consume, and scale.

## The Road Ahead: AsyncAPI x Gravitee in 2025

As AsyncAPI continues to grow, expanding its tooling, maintainership, and governance, Gravitee’s support will help us scale with intention and care. From better docs and contributor onboarding, to new design systems and international webinars, Gravitee’s sponsorship helps bring these initiatives to life.
We're especially thrilled to have them with us at the **AsyncAPI Conference 2025**, as we bring together contributors, users, and curious minds from across the globe. Gravitee's support ensures that we can keep these conferences accessible and meaningful for all.

Thank you Gravitee for standing with us, and continuing to believe in the power of open, asynchronous systems. 💜
