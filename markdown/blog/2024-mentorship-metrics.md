### Feedback

> Thank you for giving me the opportunity, and my background does not define me, contributing to OSS.

> The program is already doing well. I believe if the suggestions made by Ace during one of our community meetings to add certifications are included then the program will be even better.

> The program is just amazing for contributors like me who are starting their journey.

> First off, I'll say a very big thank you!

> I've grown so much in this program, and I owe it to the AsyncAPI Initiative.

> Please don't take initiatives that are out of your bandwidth, like to get some feedback on my work, I had to personally dm 5 to 6 people and except for derberg and ace, sometimes the rest don't give a damn.

> The program goal is clear. But one thing that Lukasz always say that we have to focus more on maintainership. Including projects that require maintainership will be very helpful to the community. I agree to this point, it will be giving AsyncAPI community a lot of dedicated contributors.

> The program is very impactful especially to early-career techies like me so I could grow in open source

> So, for one, I suggest a better structure that kicks things off immediately after the mentees are announced. That way, we still have that excitement we had getting into the program reserved all the way to the end (Or at least the first evaluation)

> nah, everything is perfect.

### Conclusion

A big thank you to everyone who participated in this program, from the kickoff discussions to the wrap-up event. Y'all are the special ones. And to those spreading the word about the AsyncAPI Mentorship Program, you all belong on the cover of Essence.

Finally, a special shout-out to the mentors for making this edition of the program a success. We'll keep you updated on future entries for the AsyncAPI Maintainership Program this year, so stay tuned.
