As May ushers in the warmth of spring, while some of us in the southern hemisphere brace ourselves for the upcoming winter season, it's also a time to recognize and celebrate the dedication of those who contribute to projects that drive innovation in the community. 

**Happy Maintainers Month to all the AsyncAPI maintainers**! Your hard work and commitment significantly impact the community, ensuring that collaboration and progress thrive. Thank you for everything you do!
