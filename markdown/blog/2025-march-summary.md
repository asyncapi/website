excerpt: 'AsyncAPI community status and project updates for March 2025'
featured: true
---

We started the month with exciting news as [AsyncAPI got accepted to the Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/organizations/asyncapi) (GSoC'25). In the last weeks, the community has seen many enthusiasts join the workspace in anticipation of being accepted to the program. 
However, this excitement brought some challenges as well. Slack and GitHub became overloaded with messages, pull requests, and issues, which overwhelmed our community members and maintainers. 

We are committed to maintaining a welcoming environment for everyone, which is why we have a Code of Conduct and a committee in place to enforce it. But sometimes, too much enthusiasm can become overbearing, resulting in a few members needing to be temporarily banned to ensure a safe space.

With that being said, we view this as a valuable lesson. A big thank you to our Code of Conduct Committee for stepping up and upholding the rules.

[The application phase is officially open](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), and we look forward to welcoming new contributors to the community and potential new triages and maintainers!

## AsyncAPI Conference 2025

Our first AsyncAPI Conference is coming next month in Singapore on the 15th and 16th of April. [The speakers and agenda for the event are now available](https://conference.asyncapi.com/venue/Singapore). Stay tuned for more updates on our social media and Slack as the dates come close.

### AsyncAPI Meetup Section
We plan to introduce a meetups section under the AsyncAPI Conference umbrella, a platform enabling community members to connect, share knowledge, and discuss topics related to AsyncAPI outside of the main conference events. The goal is to foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the AsyncAPI ecosystem.

As part of preparing the section, we will have an open discussion on the guidelines and rules. Additionally, we have an open issue with the design for implementing the page for the conference website. I encourage everyone to share their thoughts and [review the AsyncAPI Meetups Section discussion](https://github.com/asyncapi/conference-website/discussions/604) and [the AsyncAPI Meetups Page issue](https://github.com/asyncapi/conference-website/issues/644).

## Spec x Tooling

We are excited to welcome a new project, [Neuroglia.AsyncAPI](https://github.com/asyncapi/net-sdk), a .NET SDK for visualizing and interacting with AsyncAPI documents donated by [Charles d'Avernas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-d-avernas-40836a13/). The project also supports a code-first documentation generator, fluent builders for intuitive and expressive API definitions, and fluent validators to ensure compliance and correctness. All the components also support the AsyncAPI v3. [Be sure to try out Neuroglia.AsyncAPI for your documents](https://github.com/asyncapi/net-sdk), especially if you are a .NET developer!

### RAML Schema Parser

Currently, we do not have active maintainers for the RAML schema parser, a standard for RAML data types. If any community member depends on this parser and is interested in maintaining the project or has any thoughts on this issue, [please reach out or share them in the open discussion about the RAML Parser](https://github.com/asyncapi/raml-dt-schema-parser/issues/255).


## AsyncAPI Governance Board 
 We are still discussing the new AsyncAPI Governance Board, which will take effect later this year. Part of the changes this will bring will be to replace the single Executive Director position and have the option of Ambassadors becoming TSC members. You still have a chance to share your thoughts and views; please do so [under the introduction of the governance board discussion](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/1634).

## AsyncAPI Bounty Program
[The AsyncAPI Bounty Program Q2 is underway](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/projects/36/views/4?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=bounty%2F2025-Q2), and we have 17 issues filled into capacity and assigned. It's exciting to see the program grow and the maintainers fully participating.

## TSC x Ambassadors
We are thrilled to welcome three new [Technical Steering Committee](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc) (TSC) members.

## Community Discussions
We have an interesting discussion about conducting usability research on some of our tools in AsyncAPI. [Aishat Muibudeen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aishatmuibudeen/) (Maya) is currently leading the efforts, and community-wide input is needed. [Please review the Usability Research for the AsyncAPI Tools discussion](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/issues/3874) and share your thoughts and insights.
