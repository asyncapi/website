excerpt: 'Time to present candidates to join AsyncAPI Governance Board and start elections.'

I'm very proud to announce the first elections for the new **AsyncAPI Governance Board (GB)**. They start today and finish in July.

In a few weeks, I can step down as Executive Director without worrying about the AsyncAPI Initiative and the community that supports it.

## Who Can Vote

Voting is open to all members of the **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)**.

We currently have [43 members](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/TSC_BOARD_MEMBERS.yaml).

## How to Vote

GB voting is not the typical automated voting process we use for simple "yes" or "no" decisions with emojis in GitHub issues and pull requests. These elections are a manual process.

As described in the [Governance document](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#voting), we use a **"first-past-the-post"** voting system.

**You should:**
* Send your vote to **info@asyncapi.io** no later than two weeks after the elections begin.
* Your vote should be a list of the candidates' names you wish to appoint as GB members.
* Since we are initially selecting three GB members, you should send **three names** of candidates.

Here's an example of a ballot (it should be a bulleted list, and the order does not matter):

```md
I vote for:
- Candidate A
- Candidate B
- Candidate D
```

The candidates with the most votes win.

I am particularly committed to exploring sustainable and scalable initiatives that will keep AsyncAPI thriving for years to come.
