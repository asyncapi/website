Happy 2025, AsyncAPI Community💜 !

What better way to start the year than by reflecting on the community's growth over the past year? Let's take a deep dive into the state of our community through data and see how far we have come, where we fell short, and what we can improve in the coming year. Analyzing our metrics is the most effective way to gauge our growth and measure our impact.

If you are curious about our past achievements, [please read the previous Project Status updates](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog?tags=Project+Status).


## Slack

We currently have a total of **6,124** members in the AsyncAPI workspace. Slack is our primary communication channel for sharing updates, assisting contributors and adopters who want to understand and use the AsyncAPI specification and toolings.

We welcomed **1,505** new members in 2024.

Among this year's new joiners, we have our top five members, including our community marketing specialist, who leads the marketing efforts in the community.

Our weekly activity slightly dropped this year due to changes that affected some of our core maintainers after the layoffs.

## Social Media 
Our social media platforms help us communicate community news, share updates, and make announcements.
Let's dive into the numbers:

### LinkedIn
We gained **995** followers on LinkedIn in 2024, bringing a total to **3,983** overall followers.

/>

Compared to 2023, the number of visits from users and new users to [asyncapi.com](https://www.asyncapi.com), referred by LinkedIn, decreased by 40% in 2024. However, on a positive note, we received a significant increase in sessions, which kept users more engaged.

  className="text-center"
/>

We don't use any premium or paid marketing services!

### X/Twitter
We gained **309** followers in 2024, reaching a total of **4709** followers overall. Website referrals declined 42% compared to the previous years, but sessions on the website increased significantly.

We don't consider the X/Twitter platform worth investment; it's time to consider another platform like Bluesky to expand our reach.

### YouTube
Our YouTube channel continues to grow as we gain **269** new subscribers, having **1.72k** subscribers in total. We hosted fewer community live streams in 2024, but also brought back the AsyncAPI Online Conference, increasing the total watch time.

### Newsletter
It's been a year since we sent out our first newsletter, and I'm pleased with the growth and impact it has achieved. Many community members often don't have the time to read through the entire article, so having a simple summary delivered straight to your inbox is a convenient way to stay updated on community happenings. The April edition was one of the most popular.

Additionally, we've seen some growth in newsletter website referrals, with an increase in users and sessions.

## Google Analytics
Docs continue to be our main metrics contributor, and blogs have performed quite well this past year. 
The AsyncAPI website received over 1.1 million page views, while users and sessions have remained consistent.

## Google Search Console
Compared to 2023, there has been a slight 15% decrease in website impressions and clicks recorded on Google Search Console.

  className="text-center"

## GitHub
We continue to see an increase in the number of active contributors who perform tasks such as commits, issues, or pull requests. In 2024, we had over **2,780** contributors overall.

We still do our very best to resolve and close issues. There have been some improvements because of programs such as the AsyncAPI Bounty Program and the Maintainership Program. We are still committed to growing the number of maintainers.

### NPM
The most controversial part of the review is the number of downloads from AsyncAPI's top packages, which are hosted under the Node Package Manager. The `asyncapi/specs` package continues to soar, with over **34M** downloads in the past year.

## Community Achievements
Despite the challenges, we achieved some milestones, and here are some of the highlights from the AsyncAPI community in 2024!
