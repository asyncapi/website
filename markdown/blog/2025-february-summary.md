It's been a busy few weeks in the community, and we are establishing an organizational structure as we continue to grow. 
[We now have the Community Working Group](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/annual-goals/2025_Community_Goals.md#community-working-group-umbrella), which serves as an umbrella for the initiatives and programs under AsyncAPI while increasing visibility for our community builder's efforts to sustain the community. 

In light of that, we are also discussing the introduction of a Governance Board to replace the Executive Director position with a board of 3 to 5 members. 
The board aims to share community responsibilities, reduce the risk of key-person dependency (bus factor), and work towards sustaining the community in the long term. [Please participate in this discussion and share your thoughts and ideas on establishing our first AsyncAPI Governance Board](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/1634).

## New AsyncAPI Mascots
The redesign of Eve and Chan, the official mascots of AsyncAPI, is now complete, thanks to the incredible work of [Victoria Nduka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorianduka). The redesign work was part of the AsyncAPI Bounty Program, and you can find the illustrations in the [AsyncAPI Mascot Redesign Documentation](https://github.com/asyncapi/brand/tree/master/illustrations/mascots).

Many have been wondering who Eve and Chan are. Stay tuned for an upcoming blog post explaining the concept behind the mascots. [Be sure to subscribe to our newsletter to read all about it](https://www.asyncapi.com/en/newsletter)!

## AsyncAPI Budget 2025
The 2025 budget voting for the initiative was approved. We also improved TSC voting by sending message reminders to members who haven't voted yet to increase participation. Thanks to [Ashish Padhy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashish-padhy3023) for working on the implementation.

The program is designed for you, so submit any issues requiring attention [under the Bounty Program 2025 issue submission discussion](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1607).

## AsyncAPI Conference 2025
We are still seeking Financial Sponsors for the AsyncAPI Conf 2025 to assist community members with travel expenses. [Please help us by sharing the conference prospectus within your networks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LxTFLWkRmFQkHOyrwZBL7yqSO2_XPJNq/view?usp=sharing) to enhance the experience.

Our first stop will be in Singapore **on April 15th and 16th**, and we have an incredible lineup of speakers. The agenda and ticket details will be shared soon, [so check the Conference Website regularly for updates](https://conference.asyncapi.com).

## Community Discussions
We have an open discussion on the idea of having an AsyncAPI AI Hackathon, and we are looking for ideas and use cases that can impact the community. Please share your suggestions or thoughts on the [AsyncAPI AI hackathon discussion](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1702).

## TSC Members
We are excited to welcome new [Technical Steering Committee](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc) (TSC) members.
