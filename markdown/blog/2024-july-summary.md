It's been a month since our partnership with Postman ended, and some of our maintainers at AsyncAPI lost their jobs. However, we are proud of sponsors like IBM, who continue to support open source and the Initiative. Please take a moment to read [Salma Saeed's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/s-saeed/) article [on how IBM is supporting AsyncAPI in breaking the boundaries of Event-Driven Architecture](https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-continues-to-support-opensource-asyncapi-in-breaking-the-boundaries-of-event-driven-architectures).

We also encourage the community to [continue sharing and assisting the impacted professionals in finding new opportunities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LSL2Tt72h29S8UoxCHeBEuwWGhbnpJPEI6Psa5dLqkQ).


## AsyncAPI Conference's

### AACoT'24 London
We are excited to announce a fantastic line-up of speakers and engaging topics for our AACoT'24 London edition. Keep an eye out on our Slack workspace for ticket announcements and other important updates for the event. 
For a sneak peek of what to expect, [be sure to take a look at AACoT'24 London Agenda](https://conference.asyncapi.com/venue/london).

### AACoT'24 Online Edition
Preparations for our online conference are well underway. We have begun implementing our Call for Speakers page, thanks to the amazing contributions of [Ashmit Jagtap](https://github.com/ashmit-coder). For a glimpse of how this is coming along, [please review the Call for Speakers form pull request](https://github.com/asyncapi/conference-website/pull/348).

In the meantime, please start preparing your talk submissions and get ready to present on the conference day, on the 30th of October.

### AsyncAPI Conf in Paris
[We are excited to announce that the Call for Proposals](https://conference.asyncapi.com/venue/paris) for our "main event" in Paris is now open. Start preparing your talks and submit them before the final deadline on September 20th. Don't miss it!

**Please Note: When submitting your proposal, choose the "*AsyncAPI Conference (part of apidays Paris- Dec 5)*" option and then the AsyncAPI track.** 

## Spec x Tooling

### New Project

After a successful vote, we will onboard a new project called [Kotlin-asyncapi](https://github.com/OpenFolder/kotlin-asyncapi). This project consists of code-first tools that simplify the creation of AsyncAPI documentation for Kotlin applications. It allows developers to write the AsyncAPI docs in Kotlin code using a DSL or generate it directly from the code. Additionally, it integrates with Spring Boot to serve the generated docs via a REST endpoint.
For more details, [please refer to the open discussion on Donate kotlin-asyncapi](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/1313). If you want to familiarize yourself with the codebase, [check out the kotlin-asyncapi repository](https://github.com/OpenFolder/kotlin-asyncapi).

Thanks to [Lorenz Simon](https://github.com/lorenzsimon), who chose to move the project under the AsyncAPI umbrella to enable collaboration with a wider community. Lorenz is also searching for volunteers to join him as project maintainers.

### Call for New Maintainers
The [TypeScript/Node.js NATS](https://github.com/asyncapi/ts-nats-template) and [.NET C# NATS template](https://github.com/asyncapi/dotnet-nats-template) generators are looking for new maintainers. If you want to maintain these templates, please express your interest in the [ts-nats-template discussion](https://github.com/asyncapi/ts-nats-template/issues/650) or the [dotnet-nats-template discussion](https://github.com/asyncapi/dotnet-nats-template/issues/651).

### AsyncAPI v3 Support
We are excited to have the AsyncAPI Validator by [Waleed Ashraf](https://github.com/WaleedAshraf) as one of the latest projects to support v3. The AsyncAPI Validator project validates your messages against your AsyncAPI document. Be sure to test and [try out the AsyncAPI Validator for your projects](https://github.com/WaleedAshraf/asyncapi-validator).

## AsyncAPI Bounty Program
[The AsyncAPI Bounty Program Q3](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/projects/36/?pane=info) is making good progress. Out of the 9 assigned issues, 3 are now complete. [We have awarded $600 for the completed tasks, and an additional $400 will be processed by the end of July](https://opencollective.com/asyncapi/expenses?searchTerm=bounty&collectiveSlug=asyncapi&period=2024-06-30T22%3A00%3A00.000Z%E2%86%92all).

## Mentorship Programs
Our Google Summer of Code'24 mentors have recently submitted their mid-term evaluations, and we are thrilled that 7 out of 8 mentees passed their evaluation. We still have one more mid-term evaluation, and I'm confident they will also pass, as the mentees are working hard on their contributions.

[You can check out the accepted AsyncAPI project list](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/organizations/asyncapi) and see what the mentees are working on.

## Technical Steering Committee
To improve transparency in the project and ensure regular monitoring of the TSC's participation, we have implemented an automated report of TSC voting with support from [Aayush Saini](https://github.com/AayushSaini101). The report provides detailed information about the voting process, and [you can check out the first version of the TSC Overview doc report](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/TSC_VOTING_OVERVIEW.md).

As a TSC member, if you identify incorrect data, [please create an issue in the community repository](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues) with the correct information, as it will allow us to review and address any issues with the automation process or voting discrepancies.


## Coming in August
- **AsyncAPI Community Updates Newsletter** - The August Edition issue will arrive in your inbox on the 7th. Ensure [you subscribe to the AsyncAPI Newsletter](https://www.asyncapi.com/newsletter).
