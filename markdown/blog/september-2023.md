excerpt: 'September and October Community Update'
---

Our second AsyncAPI Conf on Tour took place on the 19th of October, hosted by SNGULAR in Madrid. The day was well-organized, packed with informative talks from industry experts and great networking sessions, making it a valuable experience for attendees. Additionally, the conference was live-streamed, and every session was recorded, so even if you missed out on attending the event in person, you can still [watch the recordings on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbi1gRlP7pihD-7XYb6c9wcTdkavDzF3_) and catch up on all the insightful talks.
 Our gratitude goes to [Ivan Garcia Sainz-Aja](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivangarciasainzaja/) for helping us bring SNGULAR on board, plan, and host the event.

## Spec x Tooling
[Sergio Moya](https://github.com/smoya), [Peter Ramos](https://github.com/peter-rr), and the team are currently working on measuring the AsyncAPI adoption by collecting metrics through the usage of our tools. If you are interested in participating or following up on the progress, you can join the public discussion on [Measuring AsyncAPI Adoption](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/879).

We're excited to share that we have successfully migrated Modelina from v1 to v2. The new version will focus more on creating accurate array types. For more information, please check out the [Modelina v2 migration guide](https://modelina.org/docs/migrations/version-1-to-2). 

## Mentorship Program
The first evaluation for the 2nd cohort of the AsyncAPI Mentorship Program just concluded, and we are happy that [all the mentees participating](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/907) are doing well in their projects. They are now eligible to request the first half of their stipend by [submitting an expense through Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/asyncapi/projects/asyncapi-mentorship-2023). We are proud and can't wait for the final results.


## AsyncAPI Bounty Program
After a successful trial, we are happy that the official AsyncAPI Bounty Program is in full swing. The program will be run by three outstanding individuals, [Viacheslav Turovskyi](https://github.com/aeworxet), [Aishat Muibudeen](https://github.com/Mayaleeeee), and [Abir Pal](https://github.com/imabp), who will ensure the rules are correctly implemented and oversee the smooth running of the program.
