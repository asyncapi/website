excerpt: 'A comprehensive review of AsyncAPI Marketing Working Group achievements in 2024, including social media growth, store closure updates, and future initiatives like the Student Ambassador Program'
---


Hello, everyone! I'm Bami, I’m the Community Marketing Specialist at the AsyncAPI Initiative, and I'm honored to serve as the Chair of the AsyncAPI Marketing Working Group. This role has allowed me to develop a unique perspective on how we can connect and inspire our community, build awareness for AsyncAPI, and further enhance our presence in the ecosystem. I’d like to share an overview of what we’ve been working on for the past six months, the initiatives currently underway, and our plans for the future.

## Overview of the Marketing Working Group

The Marketing Working Group (MWG) is the driving force behind the AsyncAPI Initiative’s external engagement, community growth, and brand awareness efforts. Our mission is to encourage an active, informed, and passionate community by promoting the tools, resources, and stories that make AsyncAPI unique.
Some of the things we aim to accomplish:

- **Increase Awareness:** Develop and implement targeted campaigns to introduce AsyncAPI to a broader audience and create a clear understanding of our mission.

- **Build Engagement:** Design strategies to strengthen our community’s connection, enhance involvement, and showcase the powerful contributions of our members.

- **Highlight Impact:** Share stories, case studies, and successes from the community to inspire and inform potential contributors, users, and partners.

- **Drive Growth:** Attract new users, contributors, and partners through partnerships, events, and online activities that underscore AsyncAPI’s value in the tech landscape.
By aligning our goals with AsyncAPI’s mission, the MWG seeks to empower both seasoned and new members to engage deeply with the initiative. 

Below is a summary of what we’ve accomplished this year and our priorities moving forward.

## Accomplishments and Milestones
We’ve focused on laying the groundwork for long-term growth and engagement for the last six months. Our marketing initiatives have been designed to elevate AsyncAPI’s visibility, simplify our communication strategy, and ensure we’re prepared to grow alongside our community. 

Here’s a summary of what we’ve done so far:
- Launched targeted social media campaigns that reached 5,031 impressions, supported by our community of designers:
  - #AsyncAPIParis2024 campaign 
  - #YourAsyncAPIStory celebrating AsyncAPI at 8 

- Held successful [online event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGn8v0yBfOI) that engaged and informed over 350 community members and prospective contributors

- Implemented regular content updates on our platforms to keep followers informed and engaged

- Proposed the Student Ambassador Program initiative that aims to bring more attention to AsyncAPI's mission and tools, further building our presence and strengthening community ties

## Implementing Buffer for Social Media Management

To improve the efficiency and security of our social media management, we’ve introduced a paid version of Buffer for posting content across our platforms. This change enables us to streamline content scheduling, ensuring consistent, professional updates without compromising security. Importantly, using Buffer restricts access to the main social media accounts, adding a layer of protection and allowing us to manage permissions efficiently.

Here are some of the benefits of using the Buffer subscription
- **Centralized Dashboard:** Manage all social media platforms from a single interface, making tracking and organizing content easier. 
- **Improved Security:** No need for multiple people to log into the actual social media accounts. This minimizes the risks of unauthorized changes or breaches.
- **Better Analytics and Insights:** Access in-depth analytics to understand which posts perform and engagement metrics best and adjust strategies accordingly. 
- **Content Approval Workflow:** Allow team members to draft posts for review, ensuring high-quality content that aligns with AsyncAPI’s voice.


Please note that I currently do not have direct access to AsyncAPI’s social media accounts. Buffer provides an effective solution for posting content, monitoring performance, and maintaining the high standards of AsyncAPI's public presence without broad access.

As part of the benefit of using Buffer, we have access to our social media analytics. Below are the analytics for LinkedIn from January 1st to December 12th, 2024.

In 2024, our LinkedIn performance saw impressive growth: a 48% increase in followers (3,910 total), 104% more impressions (100,328), and 91% more new followers (911). Engagement soared with a 219% rise in clicks (4,295 total) and a 9% improved engagement rate (5.32%). We also published 44% more posts (233), highlighting consistent content efforts. 


Tracking our performance on X (formally Twitter) has not been easy. Buffer does not have access to historical data. We can see numbers that show our performance since we connected Buffer in September, but we do not have historical data to demonstrate performance improvements.




## Closing the Online Store

One significant change is the closure of our online store. After reviewing our budget allocations, it was clear that the store was not generating sufficient activity to justify its expenses. This decision allows us to redirect funds towards initiatives that better serve the community and our core goals. We’re considering alternative ways to share AsyncAPI merchandise in the future that are more cost-effective and in line with our community needs.

As of June 2024, the items in the store were 2383. The goal was to disburse all of the items by December 2024.

 Below is the breakdown of the item distribution and what we have left in the store.

- **Paris Conference:** 1518 items sent to Paris as part of conference giveaways, speakers package, and the rest to be given to the ambassadors to help them promote AsyncAPI in their communities.

- **London Conference:** 335 items shared with attendees and speakers

- **TSC Members:** 40 items packed for the TSC members to acknowledge their contributions to the community.

- **Mentors and Mentees:** 30 items distributed to mentors and mentees as tokens of appreciation for their participation in the mentorship program

- **Ambassadors:** 2 packages were sent to two new ambassadors, each containing 11 items. 

- **Community Events and Giveaways:** 25 items for various online and offline events throughout the year.

So far, $8,264.37 has been spent on maintaining the store and logistics. As part of the benefit of closing the store, merchandise will be made locally at the event location, and others will be made as per request.

## Marketing Strategy Document and Student Ambassador Program

To guide our efforts, we're currently developing a comprehensive Strategy Document (PR [#1358](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/1358)) that will outline our objectives, priorities, and target initiatives. Once finalized, the document will guide our upcoming campaigns, events, and community engagement efforts.

Additionally, we are planning to introduce the [Student Ambassador Program](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/1333), which aims to nurture future AsyncAPI advocates and contributors at the student level. The program will offer students guidance, resources, and community connections to help them grow within the AsyncAPI ecosystem. We believe this will strengthen our community and ensure that AsyncAPI remains a go-to resource for emerging talent.

## Community Growth and Future Focus Areas

Our community has continued to grow steadily, with increasing participation in events, discussions, and open-source contributions. This growth underscores the need for a well-coordinated strategy that both attracts new members and retains existing contributors.
Looking forward, we’ll focus on:

- **Implementing the Strategy Document:** Utilizing our strategic roadmap to guide all our activities and initiatives

- **Launching the Student Ambassador Program:** Engaging students worldwide to represent and support AsyncAPI within their schools and networks

- **Promotions and Partnerships:** Expanding AsyncAPI’s reach through strategic partnerships and new promotional efforts

- **Enhanced Engagement with the Community:** Creating more opportunities for community members to participate, share ideas, and grow their skills

With these focus areas, we’re confident that AsyncAPI will continue to expand its influence and provide valuable support to both seasoned and new community members.

## Sponsor Involvement in the Marketing Working Group

The Marketing Working Group thrives on collaboration, and we’re fortunate to have active participation from representatives of our sponsors, including [Christophe Dujarric](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophedujarric/) from [Bump.sh](https://bump.sh/) and [Georgie Burrows](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgieburrows/) from [Gravitee.io](https://www.gravitee.io/). Their insights, ideas, and expertise are invaluable in shaping the group’s direction and ensuring that AsyncAPI’s marketing strategies align with the broader goals of our sponsors and the community.

## Who can Join the Marketing Working Group?

The working group is designed to be inclusive and welcoming, not just for sponsor representatives, but also for any community members who wish to contribute.


This collaborative approach ensures that diverse perspectives guide our efforts and allows the Marketing Working Group to act as a bridge between AsyncAPI’s community and its stakeholders. We'd love to hear from you if you have ideas or want to contribute!


## Conclusion

This report highlights the strides made by the AsyncAPI Marketing Working Group, including targeted campaigns, streamlined social media management with Buffer, impactful merchandise distribution, the development of a comprehensive strategy document, and the proposal of a Student Ambassador Program. We've also made strategic decisions, such as closing the online store, to optimize our budget for initiatives that deliver greater value to the community.

Looking ahead, our focus will be on implementing the strategy document, fostering community growth, launching the Student Ambassador Program, and driving impactful promotions and partnerships. These efforts aim to strengthen the AsyncAPI ecosystem and create meaningful opportunities for collaboration and engagement.
