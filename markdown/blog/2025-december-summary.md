Well, believe it or not, we are in the final weeks of 2025! It's been a great year as we navigated crucial growth in the community and, of course, some challenges along the way. Most importantly, we have new experiences that continuously make us better.

As this is the last summary of the year, I'll keep it short, highlight some of the details that happened in November and December, and give a quick glimpse of what to expect next year.


## AsyncAPI Conferences

### Paris

### Developer Week 2026
Planning for the AsyncAPI Conference at DeveloperWeek 2026 is underway. Speakers are selected, and final confirmation emails have also been sent. 
The agenda is being finalized, and the conference tickets will be shared at the beginning of January.

### AsyncAPI Conference 2026

We're exploring new venues or partners who would love to host us for 2026. If you or your company can host us, or know conference organizers who would be open to have an AsyncAPI track, please share your thoughts and insights in the [AsyncAPI conference venues for 2026 discussion](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/2133).

## AsyncAPI NPM Packages Security Update

Several AsyncAPI NPM packages were compromised after an attacker injected a worm into specific versions. [Charlie Eriksen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-eriksen-a318578) first identified and reported the compromised packages, while [Łukasz Górnicki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukasz-gornicki-a621914) led the efforts to deprecate affected versions and worked through challenges with the NPM review process.

[Ashish Padhy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashish-padhy3023) supported the investigation into a GitHub Actions workflow vulnerability that likely enabled the credential theft, and [Fran Méndez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fmvilas) rotated all secrets to secure our ecosystem moving forward.

Thanks to their quick action, the issue was contained and resolved. We’re grateful to each of them for their fast, transparent, and collaborative response.

## Spec x Tooling
AsyncAPI now supports a formal media type (MIME type) for the AsyncAPI Object. This change improves interoperability and strengthens tooling capabilities for API specifications, emphasizing the importance of recognizing AsyncAPI artifacts with well-defined media types for seamless documentation, validation, and system exchanges. You can get more details [about this on the formal media type for the AsyncAPI Object issue](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/issues/936).

Additionally, Spec meetings are now back. Keep an eye [on the spec meeting issue if you're interested in joining](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/issues/1131).

## Final Remarks
I want to thank the community for taking the time to read the AsyncAPI monthly summary and for the consistent support. It has been amazing to contribute to our shared efforts throughout the year.

As we head to the holiday season, I wish everyone and your family a joyful time and a great 2026 ahead.

I'll be back next year with another detailed summary, including key insights and numbers.

**Until then, stay safe and happy holidays!**
