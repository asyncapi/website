The AsyncAPI Specification defines a set of fields that can be used in an AsyncAPI document to describe an applicationâ€™s API. While the document may reference other files for additional details or shared fields, it usually serves as a single, primary document that encapsulates the API description.

Furthermore, the AsyncAPI document acts as a communication contract between receivers and senders within an event-driven system. It specifies the payload content necessary for a service to send a message and provides clear guidance to the receiver about the message's properties.

```yaml
asyncapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Cool Example
  version: 0.1.0
channels:
  userSignedUp:
    address: user/signedup
    messages:
      userSignedUp:
        description: An event describing that a user just signed up.
        payload:
          type: object
          properties:
            fullName:
              type: string
            email:
              type: string
              format: email
            age:
              type: integer
              minimum: 18
operations: 
  userSignedUp:
    action: send
    channel: 
      $ref: '#/channels/userSignedUp'
```

<Remember>
Depending on the implemented protocol (such as MQTT, AMQP, Kafka, etc.), you may have additional fields in your AsyncAPI document. For example, for <a href= "https://github.com/asyncapi/bindings/tree/master/kafka">configuring Kafka bindings</a>.
