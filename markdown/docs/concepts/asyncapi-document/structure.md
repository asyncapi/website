title: AsyncAPI document structure
weight: 60
---

The structure of an AsyncAPI document is defined in a specific format and must follow the [AsyncAPI specification](/docs/reference/specification/latest). The structure of an AsyncAPI document has certain fields that you need to follow, although not all of them are mandatory.

## Root elements

Root elements of an AsyncAPI document provide an overview of the API's characteristics and behavior. These root elements collectively define the metadata, channels, components, and more of an AsyncAPI document. They provide a comprehensive overview of the API's characteristics and behavior.

```mermaid
graph 
A[asyncapi]
B[info]
C[servers]
D[channels]
E[operations]
F[components]

A --> B
A --> C
A --> D
A --> E
A --> F
```

### `info` field

The `info` field in an API document offers crucial metadata, including the API's title, version, description, contact details, and license. This field provides a comprehensive overview of the API, aiding developers, architects, and other stakeholders in quickly grasping its purpose and capabilities. As a mandatory element of the AsyncAPI specification, the `info` field often serves as the initial reference point for users navigating the API documentation.

The `info` field encompasses various fields such as:

- `title`: API title.
- `version`: API version.
- `description`: Brief description describing the API's purpose and features.
- `termsOfService`: URL or document specifying the API's terms of service.
- `contact`: Contact information of the API's owner or maintainer (name, email, and URL).
- `license`: API's license information, including name and URL.
- `tags`: Tags for categorizing and organizing API documentation. Also used for grouping applications logically.
- `externalDocs`:  Links to additional, external documentation related to the API.

Here's a visual representation of the `info` field and its properties:
```mermaid
graph LR
  B(info)
  C(title)
  D(version)
  E(description)
  F(termsOfService)
  G(contact)
  J(license)
  M(tags)
  P(externalDocs)

  B --> C
  B --> D
  B --> E
  B --> F
  B --> G
  B --> J
  B --> M
  B --> P
```

Below is an example of the `info` field:
```yaml
info:
  title: My Event-Driven API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: This API provides real-time event streaming capabilities.
  termsOfService: https://example.com/terms-of-service
  contact:

    description: Additional documentation 
    url: https://example.com/docs
```

### `servers` field

The `servers` field allows you to detail a range of servers, outlining the network endpoints or message brokers to which applications can connect. That field includes vital connection information like protocol, host, port, and other options, facilitating connectivity across various environments such as production, staging, or development.

Some of the fields of individual `servers` field are:

- `host`: The server host name. It may include the port. 
- `protocol`: The protocol or messaging protocol used by the server (e.g., AMQP, MQTT, WebSocket).
- `protocolVersion`: The version of the protocol used for the connection.
- `pathname`: The path to a resource in the host.
- `description`: An optional string describing the server.
- `title`: A human-friendly title for the server.
- `summary`: A summary of the server.
- `security`: A declaration of which security schemes can be used with this server. 
- `tags`: A list of tags for logical grouping and categorization of servers.
- `externalDocs`: Additional external documentation for this server.
- `bindings`: A map where the keys describe the name of the protocol and the values describe protocol-specific definitions for the server.

Here's a visual representation of the `server` object and its properties:
```mermaid
graph LR
  A[server]
  B(host)
  C(pathname)
  D(protocol)
  E(protocolVersion)
  F(description)
  G(title)

        description: Provide your API key as the user and leave the password empty.
    tags:
      - name: staging
        description: Staging environment
    externalDocs:
      description: Additional documentation for the staging server
      url: https://example.com/docs/staging
    bindings:
      amqp:
        exchange: my-exchange
        queue: my-queue
```

### `channels` field

With the `channels` field, you can provide a map of different channels the application communicates with during runtime. The `channels` represent the communication pathways through which messages are exchanged. You can specify their purpose, address, and the expected message formats for communication. Consumers of the specific API can understand the supported message-based interactions and the corresponding data models.

Key components within the `channels` field include:

- `address`: A string representation of this channel's address.
- `messages`: A map of the messages that will be sent to this channel by any application at any time.
- `title`: A human-readable title for the channel.
- `summary`: A short yet brief summary of the channel.
- `description`: A description of the channel, providing additional context and details of the message.
- `servers`: An array of `$ref` pointers to the definition of the servers in which this channel is available. If servers are absent or empty, this channel must be available on all the servers defined in the `servers` field. 
- `parameters`: A map of the parameters included in the channel address.
- `tags`: A list of tags for logical grouping of channels.
- `externalDocs`: Additional external documentation for this channel.
- `bindings`: A map where the keys describe the name of the protocol and the values describe protocol-specific definitions for the channel.

Here's a visual representation of the `channels` field and its properties:
```mermaid
graph LR
  A[channel]
  B(address)

  R(externalDocs)

  A -->B
  A --> C
  A --> D
  A --> E
  A --> H
  A --> J
  A --> M
  A --> P
  A --> R
```

Below is an example of of the `channels` field with one channel:
```yaml
