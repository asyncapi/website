## What is an application?
An application is any computer program or a group of them. 

An application could also be a micro-service, IoT device (sensor), mainframe process, etc. Users may even write applications in different programming languages if they support one of the selected protocols. 

## Why do we need applications?
In Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), an application must be a `producer`, a `consumer`, or both. Applications must also use the protocols the server supports if they wish to connect and exchange messages.

### Applications: producers and consumers

        B --> C[channel] 
        C --> D[message] 
        D --> F[CONSUMER application]
```
The above diagram describes a message communication traveling through a channel between a **PRODUCER application** and a **CONSUMER application**.
