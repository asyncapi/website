## Usage in an AsyncAPI document

To learn how to add bindings to your AsyncAPI document, read [Adding bindings](/docs/concepts/asyncapi-document/adding-bindings) concept document, or read the guide about using [Kafka bindings](/docs/tutorials/kafka/bindings-with-kafka).

## Contributing to bindings

Bindings are maintained by different community members that know and use given protocol and technology in production. If something can be improved, or some new binding is needed, open an issue in [bindings repository](https://github.com/asyncapi/bindings).
