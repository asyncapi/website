## AsyncAPI docs onboarding checklist

As an open-source initiative with a global community, technical writer contributors should learn about our governance documents, documentation processes, and communication channels. 

Complete in order the following onboarding tasks:

- [ ] Read the [AsyncAPI Code of Conduct](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- [ ] Read the [AsyncAPI Slack etiquette](../060-meetings-and-communication/slack-etiquette). 
- [ ] Join [the AsyncAPI Slack workspace](https://asyncapi.com/slack-invite).
- [ ] Add the AsyncAPI calendar found in [the AsyncAPI events page](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/events).
- [ ] Read the list of [technical writer contributor responsibilities](../010-contribution-guidelines/technical-writer-contributor-responsibilities).
- [ ] Read and familiarize yourself with the [prerequisite knowledge topics](../010-contribution-guidelines/prerequisite-knowledge).
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the [AsyncAPI Style Guide](../011-styleguide).
- [ ] Read all docs under the following content buckets: `Concepts`, `Tutorials`, `Reference`. (Take the time to go through each tutorial.)
- [ ] Set up your local environment following our instructions for the [AsyncAPI git workflow](../010-contribution-guidelines/git-workflow).
- [ ] Introduce yourself in AsyncAPI Slack in the `#01_introductions` channel and the `#13_docs` channel. Ask docs-related questions in #13_docs.
