## Donating Your Project

Donating your open-source project to an open-source initiative involves transferring ownership or stewardship to an organization that supports and promotes open-source software. It ensures the project's sustainability, attracts more contributors, and aligns it with broader community goals.

AsyncAPI initiative is open to receiving project donations that align with our goals and values. Before considering donating your project to the initiative, kindly visit our [AsyncAPI Roadmap](https://www.asyncapi.com/roadmap) to learn more about what we are looking at as a community in the near future. 

### Project Licensing

Donating your project to an open-source organization like AsyncAPI can be exciting, hence why we need to ensure one of the most important parts of open-source projects, which is licensing. 

The AsyncAPI Initiative uses the [Apache-2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), which ensures our projects are open-source and community-driven. Before considering putting your project up for donation, ensure your project uses a compatible open-source license. 

### Legal Consideration

All the projects under the AsyncAPI initiative are strictly community-driven. We've put legal consideration into donating projects to the initiative.

- We value Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) as they provide project maintainers with the necessary legal rights to distribute and modify code contributed by different individuals, ensuring protection for both maintainers and contributors.

- We make Intellectual Property (IP) Review essential when donating projects from organizations instead of individual contributors. It's crucial to verify ownership and the chain of title to ensure that no proprietary code or third-party IP is included, maintaining a clear and respectful process for all involved.

### Community Engagement

When donating your project to a community-driven initiative like AsyncAPI, you should understand that communication is an integral part of the initiative. Before donating your project, communication with the community has to be established.

Follow the instructions below to establish and involve the community in your project donation:

1. Visit [AsyncAPI Initiative Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions).
2. Create a new discussion by clicking on `New discussion` and selecting the `Idea` category. Specify in the _title_ that you want to donate to an existing project. In the _description_, state the purpose of the new repository and why it should be part of the AsyncAPI organization. Here's a  [sample discussion about donating an existing project](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/643).
3. Start a discussion with community members to discuss the project idea, specify if you want to use AsyncAPI CI/CD workflows, and volunteer to become a maintainer for that project. For better visibility, share the discussion in the `#general` channel on our Slack. 
4. Answer questions from contributors and maintainers about your project. Ask relevant questions about your project donation.

### Project Migration

After a successful community engagement, we move on to the final phase of project migration. Establish a successful project migration via the following steps:

1. Visit the [AsyncAPI Community Repo](https://github.com/asyncapi/community) and open a [new issue](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=enhancement.yml&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+%3Cdescription%3E). 
2. Write your project's details and include a summary of the community discussion for your project.
3. Tag the `@asyncapi/tsc_members` at the end of the proposal description and ask for a vote on migrating your project to the organization, because the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) must approve the project donation. Tagging TSC members notifies them to vote on the proposed project.  
4. If the TSC approves the new repository, then either `@derberg` or `@fmvilas` complete the project migration to the AsyncAPI organization. 
5. Configure the CI pipelines to match the initiative's standards, so that either `@derberg` or `@fmvilas`can run AsyncAPI CI/CD workflows that push basic GitHub Actions workflows to the newly donated project. 
6. New maintainers are invited as repo admins.

### Post Donation Maintenance

Successfully donating a project doesn't mean the end of your journey with it. On the contrary, the post-donation phase is crucial for the sustained health and growth of the project. Ensure your project continues to thrive and benefits the community long after donation by implementing these key practices:

- **Ongoing Contributions**: Your involvement shouldn't stop with the donation. Continue actively contributing to the project by adding new features, refining existing functionalities, and fixing bugs. Demonstrating ongoing commitment encourages others to contribute as well.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep the project's documentation up-to-date. Write documentation for installation, configuration, usage, and API reference materials. As the project evolves, it's essential that the documentation reflects these changes accurately to assist both new and existing users.
- **Community Support**: Engage with the community by offering support, answering questions, providing feedback on user suggestions, and addressing any concerns. A vibrant, supportive community is key to a project's sustainability.
