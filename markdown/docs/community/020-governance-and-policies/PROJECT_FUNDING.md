## Enhancing Event-Driven Architectures - Support AsyncAPI Initiative

### Overview

AsyncAPI Initiative is dedicated to advancing Event-Driven Architectures (EDA) and creating a robust ecosystem of supporting tools. We invite you to join us in this mission by providing financial support to ensure the initiative's sustainability and growth.

To maintain momentum and expand impact, funding is crucial. All sponsor funds are reinvested directly into community development.

### How you can support us

The most straightforward way to support AsyncAPI is through financial sponsorship. While there are other options available, they may require more effort.

#### Monetary contributions

- **GitHub Sponsors**: Visit our [AsyncAPI GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/asyncapi).
- **Open Collective**: Explore our [AsyncAPI Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/asyncapi).
- **Linux Foundation Crowdfunding**: Check out our [AsyncAPI Linux Foundation Crowdfunding page](https://crowdfunding.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/projects/445898e9-42a2-4965-9e0a-c2a714f381bc).

#### Other forms of financial support

##### Employee involvement

Assign your employees to contribute to projects under AsyncAPI Initiative on a regular basis, and we'll welcome them as new maintainers. You can also provide direct assistance to a member of the [Technical Steering Committee](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc) (TSC) through contracts or employment for specific tasks.

##### Event organization

Host AsyncAPI conferences by sponsoring and organizing events under the AsyncAPI brand at your provided venue.

##### Service provision

AsyncAPI Initiative relies on numerous tools, many of which incur costs. Your organization can provide services such as hosting or storage to support our efforts.

### Expense management

Funds from GitHub Sponsors are directly transferred to our AsyncAPI Open Collective account. We maintain transparency in all expenses, and the TSC approves anticipated expenses.

### Where your contributions go

AsyncAPI Initiative requires financial support to address various needs:

#### Mentorship

Our AsyncAPI Mentorship program provides paid guidance to community members, enabling them to develop valuable features for AsyncAPI projects. By investing in innovative tools and motivated individuals, we ensure your contributions benefit the community.

#### Hiring

To meet the demands of our growing community, we require full-time commitment. With the help of Open Collective, we can hire individuals to work on AsyncAPI Initiative. We recently welcomed [Thulie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/v-thulisile-sibanda/) as our community manager and plan to expand our team further.

#### Swag store

We aim to establish our own swag store to efficiently distribute merchandise to contributors, mentees, ambassadors, and other community members. Part of the proceeds from the store can help cover the cost of complimentary swag.

#### Bounty Program

Our Bounty Program seeks to recognize and reward dedicated contributors and maintainers without relying solely on company-sponsored employees or volunteers. It also provides newcomers with the opportunity to build their contributor portfolios, making it easier for them to secure rewarding tech jobs.

#### Services

Occasionally, we must pay for services such as Zoom or Descript, as they are not available through specific Open-Source support programs.

#### Events

Organizing AsyncAPI conferences involves expenses for various services and travel arrangements. Your contributions enable us to host these events and grow our community further.

### Success Stories

Thanks to financial support we can already see many success stories in the project:

#### Community Manager

As a result of hiring dedicated Community Manager we now have a regular monthly newsletter and [status update article](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/march-2023). We are now regularly present on social media and can drive forward many initiatives like events organization, for example.

#### AsyncAPI Mentorship

Thanks to the mentorship launched in 2022 we managed to:
- [Add Kafka support](https://github.com/asyncapi/glee/issues/256) to the Glee framework
- Implement single place for the whole community to [share AsyncAPI-related tool](https://www.asyncapi.com/tools)
- Create [library for error handling](https://github.com/asyncapi/problem) that we can use in different projects

#### AsyncAPI Conference

Every year we organize a conference that attracts many participants. Only last year the conference generated [3k views](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbi1gRlP7pijRiA32SU36hD_FW-2qyPhl). We plan to do a series of events in different locations every year.
