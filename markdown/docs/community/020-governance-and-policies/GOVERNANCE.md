## Governance Board (GB) members

You can determine who the current GB members are by filtering the [MAINTAINERS.yaml](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.yaml) and the [AMBASSADORS_MEMBERS.yaml](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/AMBASSADORS_MEMBERS.yaml) with the `isBoardMember` set to `true`. We also transparently list all the GB members in [AsyncAPI Website](https://asyncapi.com/community/board)

To become a GB member, you need to be a member of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC). To become a member of TSC, you need to be either an Ambassador or a Maintainer. 

### Election of the Governance Board

Elections are conducted every 12 months. Initially, 3 board members will be elected. After a period of 12 months, two additional members will be elected. This cycle recurs every 24 months. The elections will serve to either re-elect incumbent members or appoint new individuals to the board.

- At least 60 days prior to elections, the Governance Board (GB) must invite the community to suggest candidates. It must be done through a blog post that will be promoted via the current AsyncAPI communication channels.
- Community members may also submit their own applications. 
- Information about a candidate must be sent to info@asyncapi.io no later than 30 days before elections.
- Nominee must agree to be nominated.
- The list of candidates must be published on the AsyncAPI website no later than 2 weeks before elections.
- Concerns about candidates should be reported to the Code of Conduct Committee. 
- GB calls out for voting by presenting the candidates and instructing people how to vote. Voting is private because we need to respect candidates and possible issues related to public rejection. Candidates know their results. Only winners and their votes are presented to the public.
- TSC members are free to share publicly who they voted for.

#### Explanation of the Board Election and Term Cycle

Board Composition: The board consists of 5 members, each serving a term of 24 months.

Staggered Elections:

- Initial Year (Month 0): At the start, 3 members are elected. These members will serve for 24 months.
- 12 Months Later: After one year, the remaining 2 members are elected. These members will also serve for 24 months.

Continuous Cycle:

- After the initial 24 months, the terms of the first 3 members come to an end. These positions are up for re-election or reappointment.
- One year later (after the 24-month period of the second group ends), the positions of the remaining 2 members are up for re-election or reappointment.

This system ensures a staggered rotation of board members, maintaining continuity in governance while allowing periodic introduction of fresh perspectives.

#### Interim Election

In the event that a board member's term is terminated prior to its scheduled end, the organization shall ensure that a replacement election is organized and completed within 60 days from the date of termination to fill the vacancy and maintain the full composition of the board.

### Duties and Responsibilities

Among others, the duties and responsibilities of the GB include:

- Ensure compliance with the [charter](CHARTER).
- Maintain a safe and inclusive environment for all AsyncAPI participants.
- Sustain AsyncAPI’s economic viability, including sponsorship and funding strategies.
- Securely manage credentials for all AsyncAPI services.
- Oversee AsyncAPI employees and hiring.
- Ensure authorized access to AsyncAPI services.
- Conduct regular GB succession via a transparent voting process.
- Manage funding streams (e.g., Open Collective, GitHub Sponsors).
- Serve as a servant leader with authority limited to what is specified in the [charter](CHARTER); all proposals require TSC approval.

Please note that the list above is not an exhaustive list and should not be treated as a legal document, but just for reference.


### Governance Board Chairperson

Board members will appoint a chairperson during the first board meeting following an election. The chairperson's term will last 12 months.

## Technical Steering Committee (TSC) members

You can determine who is a TSC member and has the right to vote from [MAINTAINERS.yaml](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.yaml) and [AMBASSADORS_MEMBERS.yaml](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/AMBASSADORS_MEMBERS.yaml), `isTSCMember` properties. We also transparently list all the TSC members in [AsyncAPI Website](https://asyncapi.com/community/tsc).

Any maintainer and any ambassador can change their status by editing `isTSCMember` properties.

## Voting

TSC Voting process and all related rules are described in detail in [voting procedure document](voting).

GB election voting is a separate manual process run by current GB members:
- The vote should be sent to info@asyncapi.io not later than two weeks after the elections start
- The vote should be a list of candidates that voters want to be GB members. If there are 2 slots available, the voter should send 2 names; if 3, then the voter should send 3 names. We follow [first-past-the-post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) voting process. Candidates with the highest number of votes win.

## Past directors

We no longer have Executive Directors in the project.
