This Charter sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the AsyncAPI open project, which has been established as AsyncAPI Project, a Series of LF Projects, LLC (the “Project”).  LF Projects, LLC (“LF Projects”) is a Delaware series limited liability company. All Contributors (including Committers and other technical positions) and other participants in the Project (collectively, “Collaborators”) must comply with the terms of this Charter.

### 1. Mission and Scope of the Project

1. The mission of the Project is to provide open-source vendor-neutral specification(s) and tools to facilitate the development and governance of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
2. The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration, and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation, or adoption of the open-source project.
3. The vision and strategy of the Project will be defined in the ROADMAP view within the Project’s website.

### 2. Technical Steering Committee

1. The Technical Steering Committee (the “TSC”) will be responsible for the oversight of the open-source Project.
2. The TSC appoints the Governance Board as described in Section 3.
3. TSC membership is not time-limited. There’s no maximum size of TSC. The size is expected to vary in order to ensure adequate coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to make decisions efficiently. The TSC must have at least three members.
4. No more than one-fourth of the TSC members may be affiliated with the same employer. If the removal or resignation of a TSC member, or a change of employment/affiliation by a TSC member, creates a situation where more than one-fourth of the TSC membership shares an employer, then the situation must be assessed by TSC. In any case, the number of TSC members affiliated with the same employer must not be higher than one-third (round half up number).
5. Voting members of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) include committers of any Project's code repository and AsyncAPI Ambassadors. The TSC documents in the project’s GOVERNANCE file the method for determining voting members.
6. TSC members may resign anytime and also ask to be added to the TSC list anytime, as long as the requirements are met.
7. Any meetings of the TSC are intended to be open to the public, recorded, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.
8. TSC projects generally will involve Contributors, Committers, and Ambassadors. The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the Project’s GOVERNANCE file.
9. TSC members are expected to regularly participate in TSC voting.
10. In the case where an individual TSC member -- within any three-month period -- does not participate in TSC votes, the member shall be automatically removed from the TSC.
11. A TSC member may be removed from the TSC by the majority approval of the other TSC members.
12. The TSC may decide to change the Project’s vision and strategy. In that case, TSC voting must follow the approach described in Section 5.
13. The TSC may (1) establish workflow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.
14. Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include:
    1. Coordinating the technical direction of the Project;
    2. Approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project’s scope);
    3. Organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects;
    4. Creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements;
    5. Appointing representatives to work with other open-source or open standards communities;
    6. Establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies;
    7. approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with the series manager of the Project (as provided for in the Series Agreement, the “Series Manager”) to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 6 of this Charter;
    8. Directing the allocation of community donations on crowdfunding platforms;
    9. Discussions, seeking consensus, and, where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; and
    10. Coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project.
