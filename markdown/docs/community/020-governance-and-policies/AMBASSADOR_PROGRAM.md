This document covers the organizational and operational aspects of the AsyncAPI Ambassador Program.

### What is the AsyncAPI Ambassador Program?

The AsyncAPI Ambassador Program aims to bring AsyncAPI closer to both current users and potential new project users. It also aims to provide users and community members with the necessary tools and resources to:

- Promote user cooperation and disseminate the necessary tools to any specific user.
- Engage with the project in some way, either as a contributor, blogger, speaker, etc.
- Speak at community events or write technical content (i.e., blog posts) that solves community needs.
- Nurture community growth and a welcoming environment to spread knowledge about the project.

### How does the program work?

- The ambassador selection process will be as transparent as possible.
- The model currently in place for adding members to the Technical Steering Committee through PR will be used.
- The TSC or delegated maintainers of community repositories will evaluate applications according to compliance requirements via a traditional PR flow.
- All ambassador information will be displayed on the AsyncAPI website in a list after the PR is merged.
- The program has the team tag `@asyncapi/ambassadors` to notify ambassadors on GitHub.

### Ambassador requirements

The participation will be determined and checked annually. The minimum requirement for being an ambassador is to make **4 contributions per year** in the form of articles, talks, videos, podcasts, presentations, driving initiatives, etc.

Ambassadors can be invited to review content (i.e., articles, talks, videos) related to the community. These reviews are optional and will be counted as an additional contribution.

Some clarifications on the type of contributions:
    
- Articles, videos, and podcasts can be published on [asyncapi.com/blog](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog) or other domains. 
- Talks and presentations can be displayed at different events or workshops. Within it, AsyncAPI should appear at the core of the presentation. The presentation would never be used as a disguised marketing tool for other products/projects.
- Special contributions should be driven to support the community or enhance its visibility (i.e., getting new sponsors or driving initiatives) 
- If we did not identify the contributions, just let us know.
         
Examples: 

1. If contributors publish 3 articles and propel 1 initiative about AsyncAPI in eight months, they will become ambassadors for the whole year.
2. If contributors make 1 presentation, write 2 articles, and propel 1 initiative, they will become ambassadors for the whole year.
3. If you were accepted as ambassador on the 5th of May 2022, you have already fulfilled the requirements. On the 5th of May 2023, we will check if you qualify again after the 5th of May 2022.
   
### Ambassadors duties

- All our respects for your contribution!

### Become an AsyncAPI Ambassador

The process of becoming an ambassador is very simple. Go to the **community** repository and open a PR to edit the `AMBASSADORS_MEMBERS.yaml` file. The TSC will then evaluate your candidacy!

> **The process of obtaining the GitHub ID number**
> - The Ambassador Candidate adds their GitHub handle to `https://api.github.com/users/` to form link similar to https://api.github.com/users/derberg and puts into the browser's address bar.
> - Presses Enter.
> - The API returns a JSON object in which property `id` equals a number (in the case of the example, the number is `6995927`). This is the number that the Ambassador Candidate needs to insert as the value of the property `githubID` in the `AMBASSADORS_MEMBERS.yaml` file.

> **The process of obtaining the Slack ID number**
> - The Ambassador Candidate finds themselves in the members list of the Slack channel `02_general`.
> - Presses on their handle.
> - In the opened `Profile` window, presses the button with three dots.
> - Chooses the option `Copy member ID`. This is the sequence of characters that the Ambassador Candidate needs to insert as the value of the property `slack` in the `AMBASSADORS_MEMBERS.yaml` file.

That PR doesn't have to be created by the ambassador candidate; any community member may open a PR to submit someone's application to the AsyncAPI Ambassador Program. 

Get on board and become an ambassador!
