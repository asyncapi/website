Mentorship is a rewarding but often demanding journey. At AsyncAPI, we understand that challenges can arise, whether it's dealing with unresponsive contributors, managing conflicting schedules, or navigating tough feedback moments. That’s why we’ve built a support system to help you handle these situations with clarity and care.

To ensure our mentors feel supported and empowered, here’s how we help you navigate the mentoring process:

### 1. AsyncAPI Mentor Support Channel

 - You’ll have access to a dedicated Slack channel exclusively for mentors
 - You'll use this space to share challenges, seek advice, or ask questions from fellow mentors and program organizers

### 2. Program Organizers Check-Ins

 - Program leads will schedule periodic check-ins **(optional)** to see how things are going, provide support, and gather feedback
 - You can always request a **one-on-one** with the organizers if you encounter blockers that need private or immediate attention (especially when handling difficult contributors)

### 3. Conflict Resolution Path

 - If you face interpersonal challenges, such as an uncooperative/nonchalant contributor or community conflicts, escalate early:
    - First, attempt a private conversation with the mentee, framed around constructive feedback
    - If the issue remains unresolved, report it to the program organizers via Slack DM or email

### 4. Time or Commitment Challenges

 - If unexpected time constraints arise or your availability as a mentor changes:
    - Let the program organizers know as early as possible
    - We can explore shared mentorship, backup mentor support, or a contributor transition plan

 - If a contributor is showing signs of non-commitment during the program phase:
    - Reach out to the contributor privately to understand the reason for no commitment
    - If there is no response within a week, please inform the program organizers as soon as possible 

### 5. Code of Conduct & Reporting
 - All mentors and contributors are expected to uphold the AsyncAPI Code of Conduct
 - For violations or inappropriate behaviour, use our [formal reporting process](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/code_of_conduct/coc-incident-resolution-procedures.md) or contact the CoC team
