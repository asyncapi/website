Evaluations are a vital part of the AsyncAPI Mentorship Program (AMP) for both contributors and mentors. Missing an evaluation can jeopardize your participation and impact stipend eligibility. To ensure a smooth and timely evaluation process, we’ve established a structured check-in system.

## Email Reminders

To help everyone stay on track, program organizers will send reminder emails ahead of each evaluation period.

Here’s the reminder schedule:

- **10 days before** the evaluation window opens
- **5 days before** the evaluation window opens
- **On the first day** of the evaluation window

These reminders will include key deadlines, evaluation links, and submission guidelines.

## Slack Direct Messages

If a contributor or mentor hasn’t submitted their evaluation within the **first 3 days** of the evaluation period, organizers will follow up via **Slack DM** to check in. This gives us time to understand any blockers, provide support, and take action where necessary to keep the program on track.

>_We strongly encourage all contributors and mentors to make this a priority. If you’re unclear on any part of the process, please get in touch with the program organizers as early as possible.
