title: Mentors Onboarding Process
weight: 100
---

The success of the AsyncAPI Maintainership Program depends heavily on the thoughtful pairing of mentors and mentees. Mentorship is more than guidance; it’s a shared commitment to growth for both the contributor and the mentor. To help mentors get started on the right foot, we’ve designed an onboarding experience that brings clarity, alignment, and confidence.

### Project Idea & Mentor Application

- **Contribute to Project Ideation**:  
     Participation in our open GitHub discussion to propose a new project idea or express interest in mentoring one from the existing list.

- **Submit Your Mentor Application**:  
    Complete the online mentor application form to formally express your interest and help us better understand your availability, expertise, and preferred mentorship style.

- **One-on-One Alignment Call**:  
    Once your application is reviewed, you’ll be invited to a short call with the program organizers. This chat helps us learn more about your experience, motivations, and how we can best support you as a mentor throughout the program.

### Confirmation & Welcome

- **Welcome Message**:  
    Once selected, you’ll receive a personal welcome message from the program organizers via AsyncAPI Slack, officially confirming your participation as a mentor.

- **Slack Access**:  
    You’ll be added to the dedicated `#maintainership-mentors` Slack channel to stay updated, ask questions, and connect with fellow mentors throughout the program.

- **Kickoff Call**:  
    You’ll be invited to a Mentor Kickoff Call **(mandatory for all mentors)** to align on goals, timelines, expectations, and answer any early questions before the program begins.

### Mentor Orientation

- **Live Orientation Session**:  
    You’ll join a live virtual orientation where program leads will walk you through:
  - The program’s structure, timeline, and key milestones
  - The support system available to mentors (e.g., async help, escalation paths)
  - Mentorship best practices, communication tips, and how to address contributor challenges.

- **Program Resources & Insights**:  
    Gain practical insights from past editions and receive access to useful resources like evaluation rubrics, messaging templates, and the AsyncAPI Mentorship Playbook to support your journey.
