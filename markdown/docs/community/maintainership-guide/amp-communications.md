# Communication Channels

Effective communication is the foundation of a successful mentorship experience. To support smooth collaboration throughout the AsyncAPI Mentorship Program (AMP), weâ€™ve established several dedicated communication channels for participants, mentors, and organizers.

## Slack (Primary Communication Hub)

Slack is the main platform for real-time communication during the program. Once accepted, participants will be added (if not already) to the official AsyncAPI Slack workspace.

Key channels include:

- **#mentorships** â€“ Program-wide updates, announcements, and shared resources.
- **#maintainership-[year]-cohort** â€“ Dedicated support channel for contributors to ask questions and seek guidance.
- **#maintainership-[year]-mentors** â€“ Mentor-only space for coordination, shared tips, and updates.
- **Direct Messages (DMs)** â€“ For private, one-on-one conversations with mentors, mentees, or program organizers.

 _Please stay responsive to messages and maintain timely communication._

## GitHub

GitHub is the primary platform for managing and tracking project work.

- **Repositories** â€“ Each project will have a dedicated GitHub repository for code, issues, and pull requests.
- **GitHub Discussions** â€“ Used by program organizers to share updates, request feedback, announce planning decisions, and collect project ideas.

_Contributors must follow contribution guidelines and use clear, descriptive messages._

## Email

All official communications from the AMP team â€” including evaluation reminders, key deadlines, and other important announcements â€” will be sent via email.

_Be sure to check your inbox regularly and avoid missing critical updates from the program organizers._

## Calendar Invites

Major events such as kickoff calls and community meetings will be scheduled through our shared community calendar.

## Staying Updated

To stay informed throughout the program:

- Monitor the **#mentorships** channel on Slack for official notices.
- Regularly check your email for evaluation and event updates.
- Watch the GitHub Discussions board for announcements and opportunities to engage.

_Tip: Turn on Slack and program's GitHub discussions notifications to ensure you never miss important updates._

If youâ€™re ever unsure where to post a question or whom to ask, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to your mentor or a program organizer.
