The AsyncAPI Maintainership Program is built around a clear and impactful vision: to transform and upskill open-source contributors into confident maintainers capable of leading and sustaining the future of AsyncAPI projects. More than just a short-term mentorship effort, the program is a strategic initiative focused on fostering long-term project health across the ecosystem through meaningful technical contributions in code, design, documentation, and beyond.

## Program Goals

- **Grow the Number of Active Maintainers**  
    Empower active contributors to become confident, independent maintainers who can lead, triage, and guide AsyncAPI projects.

- **Encourage Long-Term Engagement**  
    Foster deep contributor relationships that extend beyond the program period, encouraging sustainable, long-term involvement.

- **Transfer Knowledge and Practices**  
    Enable maintainers to pass on project-specific context, workflows, and best    practices to contributors in a structured way.
    
- **Improve Project Scalability & Sustainability**
    Help distribute the project's workload by onboarding more hands to support project  maintenance, roadmap execution, and community support.
    
- **Strengthen Community Culture**  
    Promote empathy, communication, and mentorship as essential qualities within the open-source ecosystem.

## Program Outcomes

By the end of the program, participants will have:

- Successfully contributed to key issues, features, or processes within the AsyncAPI organization projects.
  
- Gained practical experience in project maintainability, issue triaging, and release workflows (code-related projects)

- Demonstrated a clear understanding of what it means to be an open-source maintainer, technically and socially.
  
- Enough knowledge to onboard new aspiring contributors to the AsyncAPI organization, where they can learn, grow, and contribute to exciting projects.
  
- Built meaningful connections within the AsyncAPI community and developed career-impacting skills.
  
- For mentors, refined mentorship and coaching abilities, and shared ownership of the project roadmap and responsibilities.


The ultimate outcome is a more resilient and scalable AsyncAPI ecosystem led by a growing network of capable maintainers who care.
