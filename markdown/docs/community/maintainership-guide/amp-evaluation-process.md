title: Evaluation Process
weight: 240
---

Evaluations occur twice during the program duration: at the **midpoint** of the program and the **end** of the program after you submit your final work. Evaluation periods vary for different projects and are determined based on project complexity. For a standard 12-week project, your first evaluation will be at the end of the 6th week, and the final evaluation will be after the 12th week of the contributing period. 

The evaluations provide opportunities for mentors, contributors, and program organizers to assess each other's performance. 

The pass or fail decision from an evaluation should not come as a surprise. You and your mentor will already be communicating, and you should be discussing:
- Your project progress
- Contribution quality and deliverables
- Community engagement
- Any blockers or support needed before the evaluation period. 

>_If you aren't getting pre-evaluation feedback from your mentor or contributor, kindly ask for it early and often.

## How Evaluations Work

Evaluations are a survey that both the mentor and the contributor fill out during the evaluation period. Program organizers have these evaluation questions for both the contributor and the mentor in advance, saved in a **Google Form**.  

The form takes roughly **10–15 minutes** to fill out and includes questions related to:

- Scope of project
- Quality of interaction
- Skills and responsiveness
- Program contribution to learning
- Passing or failing mentor or contributor
- Quality of program organization

After the evaluation window closes, you’ll receive an email from the organizers with your result — pass or fail.

>_Submitting your evaluation is **mandatory**. Failure to complete it during any phase will result in immediate removal from the program and loss of stipend eligibility._

Organizers will keep evaluation responses **confidential**, except for specific “Feedback for Mentor” or “Feedback for Contributor” sections, which will be shared respectively. In rare cases, such as if a contributor fails, more detailed feedback may be disclosed to mentors to ensure transparency around stipend decisions.

## Final Evaluations 

At the end of the AsyncAPI Maintainership term, contributors are required to provide a link to the work they've done during the current AMP participation. This includes:

- A link to your project repository or documentation
- A brief description of completed work
- Any unfinished tasks
- Plans for continued contribution

For **documentation-related** projects with multiple contributors, stipends are shared equally among approved contributors after project completion.

_Note: If one or more contributors do not pass, their portion is redistributed among those who did._

## Payments - Be Patient

Once your evaluation is marked as “pass,” you will be eligible to request your stipend via the [AsyncAPI Mentorship Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/asyncapi/projects/asyncapi-mentorship) page.

Please allow **a few business days** for your payment to be processed after submission. If you’re unsure how to submit your expense, [refer to this guide](../stipend-and-payments/disbursement).
