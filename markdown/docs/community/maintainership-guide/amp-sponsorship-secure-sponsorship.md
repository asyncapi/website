The AsyncAPI Maintainership Program is actively seeking mission-aligned partners who are passionate about growing the next generation of open-source maintainers and ensuring the long-term sustainability of key AsyncAPI projects.

## How you can support us:

### For Organizations

**Direct Sponsorship:**
Sponsor one or more project slots. Each slot costs $2,000 and directly funds a contributor’s learning journey.

**Custom Partnerships:**
Collaborate with us on curated program content, gain community visibility, and enjoy opportunities for brand-aligned speaking engagements.

**Internship Pathways:**
Offer internship placements to our contributors, giving them real-world experience while tapping into motivated, open-source talent.

**In-Kind Contributions:**
Contribute mentors from your team, sponsor event swag, or provide tools and resources to enrich the learning experience.

### For Individuals

**One-Time or Recurring Donations:**
Every contribution, big or small, directly supports contributor stipends and mentor honorariums. Your support helps make open-source mentorship more accessible and equitable.
