Applying to the AsyncAPI Maintainership Program (AMP) is simple, but before you get started, we recommend reviewing the [program timeline](../timeline-and-schedule) to ensure you’re aware of all key dates and deadlines.

## Why Apply?

By becoming an AMP contributor (sponsored or volunteer), you can:

- Work closely with experienced maintainers on impactful, real-world projects

- Build a strong technical portfolio through consistent, hands-on contributions

- Grow into a long-term maintainer and potentially lead future initiatives

- Join a community that values learning, inclusion, and collaboration

## Paths to Application

1. **Sponsored Contributors**: Selected contributors receive a stipend for their participation in the program.

2. **Volunteer Contributors**: 
Volunteers receive the same mentorship and project experience as sponsored contributors, but do not receive a stipend. This track is ideal if you:

    - Want to learn and contribute without financial compensation

    - Are building experience for long-term open-source engagement

    - Wish to join a project even if sponsored slots are filled

## Eligibility Requirements

For either path, applicants must:

- Have made at least two contributions to any AsyncAPI project (code, docs, or community support)

- Have been active for at least 4–6 months

- Not serving as a Project Administrator or Mentor in this program cycle

- Have only participated once in AMP before

- Not be participating in another paid open-source mentorship program at the same time (this requirement applies only to sponsored contributor applicants).

## How to Apply

1. Explore Approved Project Ideas

    - Choose one that aligns with your skills and interests.

    - Remember, only listed projects will be considered.

2. Complete the Contributor Application Form
    
    - Provide detailed answers showing your interest and alignment.

3. Showcase Your Experience

    - Highlight past contributions, technical skills, and motivation.

4. Tailor Your Proposal

    - Base it on your chosen project idea.

    - Clearly outline your approach and deliverables.

5. Use the AMP Proposal Template

    - This ensures consistency and completeness.

6. Indicate Your Application Path

    - Specify whether you are applying as a sponsored or volunteer contributor.

7. Submit and Await Notification

    - Shortlisted candidates get an acceptance email with next steps.
    - Others receive feedback and are encouraged to stay involved.


## If You’re Not Selected

Not being selected isn’t the end of your AMP journey. You can:

- Stay involved in AsyncAPI projects and discussions

- Contribute in areas like documentation, tooling, and advocacy

- Reapply in future cohorts

- Ask for feedback to strengthen your application
