## The AsyncAPI Maintainership Organizer Guide

**Welcome to the AsyncAPI Maintainership Program Guide! This is a community-driven resource that captures everything we've learned from organizing, mentoring, collaborating, and building with contributors across the globe, all wrapped into one handy playbook for aspiring maintainers.**

Whether you're new to open-source or ready to level up, this guide walks you through the principles, practices, and expectations of being a successful participant in the AsyncAPI Maintainership Program.

> **Note**: The Maintainership organizer guide is an ongoing project that we continuously update as we and the broader community of program organizers learn and grow together.

## Introduction to Organizer Guide

Are you ready to grow as an open-source contributor and give back to the ecosystem?

Each cycle, maintainers/mentors drive AsyncAPI projects forward by mentoring contributors, defining meaningful work, and contributing to API standards and tooling that power real-world event-driven systems. Whether it’s your first time or you’ve mentored before, this guide aims to support your journey in experiencing most of the Maintainership program.
