## What is the AsyncAPI Maintainership Program (AMP)?

The AsyncAPI Maintainership Program (AMP) is a mentorship initiative piloted by the AsyncAPI Initiative that supports contributors in becoming long-term maintainers and leaders within the AsyncAPI ecosystem. It’s designed to provide hands-on experience, mentorship, and community support to help contributors grow their skills and make a meaningful impact in open-source.

## How long does the program last?

The core mentorship period typically lasts **12 weeks**, with a **contribution period** before the official start. During this time, mentees will work on scoped projects, receive feedback, and participate in regular check-ins with their mentors.

The timeline may vary slightly based on project complexity and mentor availability.

## Who can participate?

We welcome participants from all over the world, especially those passionate about opensource. You can apply if you are:

- Passionate about open-source, APIs, or community collaboration
- Interested in growing as a contributor and potentially becoming a maintainer

## Do mentees receive a stipend?

Yes. Selected mentees will receive a stipend for completing their project. The exact amount may vary depending on available funding and project scope.

## What kind of projects will I work on?

Projects span across AsyncAPI's ecosystem and may include:

- Improving tooling (e.g., code generation, CLI, React components)
- Enhancing documentation or creating new learning resources
- Building integrations with other technologies
- Contributing to AsyncAPI specifications or event-driven architecture guides

Each project comes with a clearly defined scope, goals, and mentorship support.

## How are mentees selected?

Mentees are selected based on:

- The quality and feasibility of their project proposals
- Their enthusiasm and commitment to learning
- Past open-source contributions
- Communication skills and responsiveness during the application phase

## Are mentors paid?

AMP mentors are dedicated volunteers from the AsyncAPI community. While they receive a $500 stipend per project as a token of appreciation, their primary reward is the opportunity to support emerging maintainers and be publicly recognized for their impact on the community.

## Do I need to be a student to participate?

No. While students are encouraged to apply, **you do not need to be enrolled in a formal education program**. AMP is open to anyone who is eager to contribute and grow within the AsyncAPI community.

## How do I stay updated during the program?

Communication happens primarily through:

- **Slack** – `#mentorships` and cohort-specific channels
- **GitHub** – for project collaboration and discussions
- **Email** – for formal updates and reminders

## Where can I find the list of available projects?

Projects are published publicly on our **Idea List**, which outlines project goals, required skills, mentors, and expected outcomes. Mentees may also propose their own ideas if they align with AsyncAPI’s mission.
## Can I participate in more than one project?

No. To ensure focus and quality, each mentee is expected to commit to **one project only** during the program.

## Can I participate as a volunteer mentee?

Absolutely! We encourage volunteer participation from contributors who are eager to learn, gain experience, and grow with the community without receiving a stipend. Volunteer mentees receive the same mentorship and guidance as sponsored participants.
