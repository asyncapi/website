Being a mentor in the AsyncAPI Maintainership Program (AMP) is incredibly rewarding, but it comes with both responsibilities and opportunities. This guide will walk you through every stage, from designing and submitting a project idea to selecting the right contributor to running a successful mentorship experience.

## 1. Before Submission: Designing a Strong Project Idea

Submitting a Maintainership Program project idea is different from proposing a typical mentorship task in programs like Google Summer of Code. AMP only accepts ideas **explicitly** designed to guide contributors toward long-term maintainership, not general one-off assignments.

A strong project idea should:

- **Support maintainership goals**: Design the project to help contributors take on responsibilities similar to a maintainer, triaging issues, reviewing PRs, leading discussions, owning releases, or driving adoption.

- **Focus on mentorship**: Include a clear, achievable timeline with room for learning and iteration. Offer both technical and non-technical growth opportunities (e.g., writing docs, community engagement).

- **Have clear milestones**: Replace vague goals like “become a maintainer” with 3–5 specific phases such as onboarding, triaging, managing a repo, or leading a release cycle.

- **Align with AsyncAPI community goals**: Whether through tooling, documentation, or community-building, ensure the project advances the initiative’s mission.

Your role at this stage:

- Write a clear and descriptive project summary.

- List expected outcomes and learning goals.

- Identify required skills and resources.

- Propose a realistic timeline with check-in points.

## 2. Submission Process

1. Review the AMP Project Idea Template.

2. Draft your project proposal with clarity, scope, and impact in mind.

3. Submit your idea via the Cohorts GitHub Discussion.

4. Join the `#mentorships` Slack channel for feedback or help from other mentors.

## 3. Selecting the Right Contributor

Once your project idea is accepted, finding the right contributor is crucial.

- **One Idea, One Contributor**: Each project is for one dedicated contributor (exceptions allowed for certain documentation projects). No team-based technical projects.

- **Prioritize interest & alignment**: Look for applicants with genuine passion, curiosity, and alignment with the project purpose.

- **Talk before you accept**: A short chat via Slack or a call can reveal motivation, communication style, and fit.

- **Request a contribution**: Ask promising candidates for a small, relevant contribution to check skills and familiarity with the stack.

- **Stick to the plan**: Once accepted, the project scope cannot be changed.

## 4. Running a Successful Project

A well-scoped project is only the beginning, maintaining balance and momentum during the program is equally important.

- **Set Healthy Boundaries**
   
   - You are not expected to be available 24/7.

   - Schedule weekly or bi-weekly check-ins.

   - Define working and non-working hours upfront.


- **Take a Break When Needed**

   - It’s okay to step back if life gets hectic.

   - Let fellow mentors or admins know if you’re overwhelmed; burnout helps no one.

- **It’s Okay to Fail a Contributor**

   - If, despite your best efforts, the pairing doesn’t work:

   - They disappear or stop communicating.

   - They oversold their skills and cannot meet expectations.

   - Persistent issues like ignoring feedback or violating community standards.

## 5. Your Ongoing Support

Mentorship doesn’t end when the program does. Many contributors grow into maintainers because their mentors stayed engaged after the official term. Keep communication open, celebrate wins, and encourage their continued involvement in AsyncAPI.
