The AsyncAPI Maintainership Program (AMP) is coordinated by a small team of two core organizers who manage everything from securing sponsorships and handling budgets to onboarding mentors, supporting contributors, and ensuring the program runs smoothly.

Volunteers play a vital role in extending this effort. Whether you're passionate about open-source, community building, mentorship, or just looking for a meaningful way to give back, AMP has a place for you.

## Roles Volunteers Can Play

As a volunteer in the AMP, you may contribute in one or more of the following capacities: 

- **Program Coordination Support**  
  Work closely with program organizers to help manage timelines, send reminders, and assist in guiding contributors through program processes and Slack discussions.

- **Community Engagement**  
  Welcome new contributors, encourage active participation in Slack channels, and help maintain healthy, inclusive communication between contributors and mentors.

- **Content & Documentation Assistance**  
  Support the creation and editing of maintainership documentation, program guides, blog posts, and promotional materials to help contributors navigate the program with ease.

- **Technical Support & Review**  
  Answer contributor questions about community tools (e.g., GitHub, CI/CD workflows), code quality, pull request etiquette, and help review contributions or proposals when needed.

- **Open-Source Culture Guidance**  
  Share knowledge on open-source best practices, AsyncAPI norms, writing good commit messages, and navigating community roles and expectations.

- **Event Support**  
  Assist in running program-wide calls such as onboarding sessions, mid-term check-ins, and final presentations. Help keep sessions on track and ensure everyone feels welcome and heard.


## Who Can Volunteer? 

We welcome volunteers from all backgrounds, especially:
