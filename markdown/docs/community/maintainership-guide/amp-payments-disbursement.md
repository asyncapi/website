>_AMP participants may receive stipends from AsyncAPI at AsyncAPI's sole discretion; these stipends are not adjusted for cost of living. All participants will receive equal stipend amounts during program participation._

The **AsyncAPI Maintainership Program (AMP)** offers stipends as a token of appreciation for the time and effort invested by contributors and mentors. These stipends are disbursed upon successful completion of the project.

## Contributor Stipends

Contributors receive their stipend in **full** after successfully passing the Final Evaluation.

To be eligible, contributors must meet all evaluation criteria and submit the required deliverables on time.

## Mentor Stipends

Mentors receive a flat stipend of **$500**, which is paid **after the completion of the program**, once they have:

- Completed both the midterm and final evaluations for their assigned contributor

- Actively supported their mentee throughout the program

- Received a passing evaluation from their contributor
