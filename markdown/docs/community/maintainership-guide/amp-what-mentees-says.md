The AsyncAPI Maintainership Program has empowered developers from around the world to grow as contributors, and gain real-world experience. Here's what some of our past mentees have to say:

_"Thanks to Missy’s mentorship, my design skills have grown tremendously, and I’ve picked up many new design terms along the way. Her constant positivity, encouragement, and support whenever I faced challenges made a huge difference. This program has been an incredible experience, and I genuinely hope AsyncAPI continues it in the future. It's a unique opportunity to learn directly from core maintainers and grow as a contributor."_ - Asmit Malakannawar


_"Thanks for allowing me to meet other people and learn lessons that will serve me. If there is one thing I’ll never forget, it’s using “This” at the beginning of a sentence because it is an antecedent."_ - Vaishnavi Nandakumar

_"Working on this project under Niktarios’ mentorship has been an incredible journey. I’ve gained invaluable insights, grown personally and technically, and felt consistently supported despite the project’s complexity. The AsyncAPI community itself is amazing, full of highly skilled and welcoming developers. I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity this mentorship program has given me. It’s been instrumental in providing real-world exposure for young developers like me. I truly hope AsyncAPI continues to grow and thrive—best wishes to the entire team!"_ - Sumant Tirkey

_"Thank you for providing such excellent mentorship during the program. I learned a lot from you and truly appreciated your guidance. I hope you continue offering the same support to future contributors. "_ - Ansh Goyal

_"Thank you for giving me the opportunity, and that my background does not define me, contributing to OSS."_ - Olumide

_"After completing my mentorship, I became a maintainer of the CLI! I've since created many issues to support newcomers, and the project has now reached over 200+ stars. Thank you for your support—I’ve learned so much from you and gained a deeper understanding of how different kinds of open-source projects work."_ - Aayush Saini
