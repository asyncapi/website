The AsyncAPI Maintainership Program (AMP) is more than just mentorship and a stipend, it’s a shared journey of learning, contribution, and community building. While AMP offers you world-class guidance and career-changing opportunities, it also relies on your dedication, collaboration, and accountability to succeed.

Think of it as a two-way street: here’s what you can expect from us, and what we expect from you.

## What You'll Gain

### Personalized Mentorship

Learn directly from AsyncAPI’s core team, including Technical Steering Committee members, Ambassadors, and experienced maintainers, who are deeply committed to your growth and to fostering a thriving open-source ecosystem.

### Real-World Experience

Work on production-grade, high-impact projects that are actively used by teams and companies. Your work will be merged, deployed, and making an impact, often during the program itself.

### Community Recognition

Gain visibility and credibility within the AsyncAPI community and the broader open-source world. You might even be invited to speak at events, share your journey, and inspire others.

### Career-Boosting Visibility
AMP is a launchpad. Many alumni have gone on to secure internships, full-time roles, or speaking engagements thanks to the skills and recognition gained here. You’ll also receive public endorsements, mentorship reviews, and a certificate of completion to strengthen your portfolio.

## What You’ll Contribute

### Communication

- **Be responsive**: Check in with your mentor regularly and communicate early if you’re stuck or unavailable.

- **Attend meetings**: Join scheduled calls on time and respect your mentor’s time.

- **Ask questions**: Curiosity shows engagement — there are no “dumb” questions.

- **Give updates**: Share progress weekly or bi-weekly, even if it’s small.

- **Be respectful**: Treat everyone with empathy, patience, and kindness.

### Collaboration

- **Engage with the community**: Join discussions, participate in bonding activities, and be active on GitHub, Slack, and sync calls.

- **Work in the open**: Publish your code under an OSI-approved open-source license.

- **Follow standards**: Adhere to AsyncAPI coding, contribution, and documentation guidelines.

- **Be open to feedback**: Use constructive criticism to improve.

- **Support others**: Offer help and celebrate fellow contributors’ wins.

### Commitment

- Dedicate at least 30 hours per week for 12 weeks to your project.

- If life throws curveballs (illness, outages, emergencies), communicate early and adjust expectations with your mentor.

- Plan around milestones, meet deadlines, and follow through on commitments.
