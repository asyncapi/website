## What is the purpose of the glossary?

**AsyncAPI's** glossary is a collection of terms and concepts that are commonly used throughout the documentation. It helps technical writers, developers, and other contributors consistently use these terms and concepts when writing tutorials and other forms of content.

## Tips for Contributors

When adding a new term to the glossary, updating the definition of an existing term, or adding a new concept to the glossary, consider doing the following:

- ✅ **Propose new terms by [raising an issue on the website's repository on GitHub](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/issues)**: This would help maintainers ensure that they fit AsyncAPI's documentation.
- ✅ **Provide clear yet specific definitions and descriptions**: This helps ensure that the glossary is easy to understand and use.
- ✅ **Keep it plain and simple**: Avoid using jargon or technical terms in the descriptions. This ensures that the glossary is accessible to a wide audience that may not be familiar with everyone.
- ✅ **Use sentence case for definitions**: This makes the glossary easier to read and navigate.
- ✅ **Present them in alphabetical order**: This makes it easier for users to find the term or concept they're looking for.

## Formatting Guidelines

When referencing terms and concepts in tutorials and other forms of content or adding new terms to the glossary, use the following formatting guidelines:

- ✅ Use `### Term Name` as the heading for each term.
- ✅ Add hyperlinks to terms and concepts mentioned in tutorials and other forms of documentation.
- ✅ Use backticks for concepts mentioned in tutorials.
- ✅ Italicize the names of concepts and bold the terms to make them distinctive from each other.

### Examples

Here are some examples of terms being used in tutorials & written as headings:

1. Term:

`### Channel`

1. Concept being used in a sentence

`In the context of designing and setting up an event-driven application, servers are responsible for delivering asynchronous messages from the producer to the consumers through the use of {'{'}**[channel](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/concepts/channel)**{'}'}.`
