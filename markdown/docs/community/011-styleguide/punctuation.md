# Punctuation

Writing documentation is important because it allows us to communicate indirectly with many people around the world. Punctuation is a crucial part of writing because it helps us make our message clear and consistent. To ensure our documents follow the same standards and are consistent with others in the industry, it's important to use the style guides that have already been recognised.

## 1. Period (.)

Use a Period to end a declarative sentence or a statement.
Some examples include:
- "I went to the store."
- "The cat is sleeping."

## 2. Comma (,)

Use a Comma to separate items in a list (including the Oxford comma).
Some examples include:
- "She bought apples, oranges, and bananas."
- "He went to the store, picked up some milk, and returned home."

Note: The **Oxford comma** is the optional comma before the conjunction in a list of three or more items. Its usage can vary based on style guides or personal preference.

## 3. Semi-colon (;)

Use a semicolon to separate two independent clauses that are closely related but could be separate sentences.
Some examples include:
- "She finished her work; then she went home."
- "I need to buy groceries; I'm running out of food."

## 4. Colon (:)

Use a Colon to introduce a list, explanation, or an example.
Some examples include:
- "Please bring the following items: a pen, a notebook, and a calculator."
- "There are three primary colours: red, blue, and yellow."

## 5. Dash (— or -)

An em Dash (—) indicates a sudden break or interruption in a sentence or provides emphasis.
Some examples include:
- "She went to the store—despite the rain—to buy some groceries."
- "She received an unexpected gift—a brand new car!"

A **hyphen** (-) joins compound words or prefixes.
Example:
- "The well-known actor starred in the movie."

## 6. Question Mark (?)

Use a Question mark at the end of a direct question.
Some examples include:
- "What time is the meeting?"
- "What is your favourite movie?"

## 7. Exclamation Point (!)

Use an Exclamation point to show strong emotion, emphasis, or surprise.
Some examples include:
- "Congratulations on your success!"
- "Happy birthday!"

## 8. Quotation Marks (" ")

Use Quotation marks to indicate direct speech or to enclose a quote.
Some examples include:
- She said, "I will be there by 5 o'clock."
- He asked, "Can you lend me a hand?"

## 9. Ellipsis (...)

Use an Ellipsis to indicate the omission of words or a pause in speech.
Some examples include:
- "I can't believe you..."
- "The best is yet to come..."
