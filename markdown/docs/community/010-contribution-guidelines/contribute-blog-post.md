## Contribute AsyncAPI blog posts

The AsyncAPI blog is open to everyone; any contribution is allowed, including reposting. You can share use cases, projects, or tools in the form of a blog post to reach out to the entire AsyncAPI community.

Posting on the AsyncAPI blog has many advantages. We'll ask on the community Slack to help promote it whenever it is released.
We'll also share it on the official AsyncAPI Twitter, LinkedIn, Hacker News, and Reddit accounts. 

Steps to submit an AsyncAPI blog post:
1. Open an [AsyncAPI blog post issue](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/issues/new?template=blog.md). 
1. Open a PR with your blog post.
1. Address all PR feedback until it gains approval from maintainers.

# Blog post requirements
Please observe the following requirements for all AsyncAPI blog post contributions:
- [Fork the AsyncAPI `website` repo](https://github.com/asyncapi/website)
- [Add a new markdown file](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/tree/master/pages/blog) with proper metadata (front matter) and the blog post content. The blog post content is up to you; it just needs to feature "AsyncAPI."
- [Place all images in our blog assets folder](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/tree/master/public/img/posts). 
   - Compress the image as much as possible; we recommend using the following tool: https://squoosh.app.
   - The output format needs to be `.webp`.
   - Include detailed `alt` descriptions for screenreader users.

- [Run our website locally or with Gitpod](https://github.com/asyncapi/website#usage) to test changes.
- Open a PR with your blog post and review your changes with the Netlify preview link.
- Address all PR feedback left by Maintainers reviewing your blog post.
- When merged, your blog post will immediately become live in production!

We encourage you to write a blog post and share it with the community. We can't wait to read it!
