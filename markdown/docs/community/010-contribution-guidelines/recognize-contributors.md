# Recognize Contributors

We do our best to recognize every contribution to the project. We do it individually in every repository from the AsyncAPI GitHub organization.

There should always be a **Contributors** section in the readme, like [this one](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/blob/master/README.md#contributors). We use [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/specification) specification to handle recognitions.

Remember, not only code matters! You can contribute to AsyncAPI in different ways. You can:
- Report a well-written issue that explains a bug or a feature that later is fixed/implemented.
- Share with us feedback on [slack](https://asyncapi.com/slack-invite) or some other channel. You come up with the idea that we used to do something great with the project.
- Improve documentation.
- Help with a review of pull requests. You are a language expert and can review docs or an expert in a specific programming language. As a result, you can review pull requests for a template written for a particular language.
- Write a blog post on the AsyncAPI blog.
- Answer to questions under issues or in Slack

You can help us out in many different ways. Just check out [this](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) list of possible contributions. All of this is a contribution!

> We apologize in advance if we failed in recognizing your work. Feel free to contact us on [slack](https://asyncapi.com/slack-invite), and we will fix it immediately, or talk to All Contributors bot directly.

## All Contributors cheat sheet

To recognize work, after it is done, in closed issue or pull request, add a proper comment. The comment must look like this:

`@all-contributors please add @{GITHUB_USERNAME} for {EMOJI_KEY}`.

Check out a full list of [emoji keys](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) although here you can find a shortlist of the most popular one:
