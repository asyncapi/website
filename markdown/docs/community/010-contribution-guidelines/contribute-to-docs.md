## Contribute to docs

There are several ways to request your first AsyncAPI docs task:

1. **Connect with a docs maintainer:** Ask for a `good-first-issue` in the `#13_docs` channel of the [AsyncAPI Slack](https://www.asyncapi.com/slack-invite) workspace. 
2. **Update current docs:** Surf the existing documentation, look for `typos`, `grammar`, `errors`, create an issue, and submit a Pull Request. 
3. **Propose new docs:** If you have any ideas or suggestions for necessary documentation, [create a new docs issue](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/issues/new?labels=%F0%9F%93%91+docs&projects=&template=docs.yml&title=%5B%F0%9F%93%91+Docs%5D%3A+) and propose yourself as the assignee.
