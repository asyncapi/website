### Become Maintainer in Existing Project

We know you are nervous about making your first contribution. In this section, we guide you on the steps towards becoming a TSC member:

1. Pick an issue
2. Open a pull request
3. Get pull request merged
4. Receive an invitation to become a code owner
5. Become a TSC member

**Step 1: Pick an Issue**

Here's how to select an issue to contribute to:
* Join existing PR reviews
* Look for issues with a [**good first issue** label](https://github.com/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aopen+org%3Aasyncapi+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
* Join the [AsyncAPI Slack community workspace](https://asyncapi.com/slack-invite) and the `#11_how-to-contribute` channel
* Ask maintainers to do a public live stream called **Let's talk about contributing** where they can explain a specific part of the project where you want to contribute.

**Step 2: Open a Pull Request**

To open a pull request successfully, follow our [Git workflows contributors guide](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/git-workflow.md).

Use the following steps to open your pull request:
1. Configure a fork
2. Work on it locally 
3. Write an appropriate PR title using the [conventional commits specification](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#conventional-commits)
4. Test your PR against GitHub checks to ensure they all pass

**Step 3: Get Pull Request Merged**

After making a pull request, allow the maintainers to review your PR. If no one is alerted to review your PR, feel free to bring the issue to the maintainer's attention by pinging them on Slack or GitHub. We sometimes delay in response for many reasons; no one intends to ignore you üôèüèº .

Make sure all your PR checks pass (turn green) to ensure your PR is merged quickly.   

**Step 4: Invitation to Become a Maintainer**

After making several contributions to AsyncAPI, maintainers will recognize you. You will then receive an invitation to join the TSC. Look at this [maintainer invitation example from the website repository](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/pull/890). If you feel that you contributed enough to become a maintainer, but maintainers did not recognize it, please open a GitHub issue in a related repository and indicate what you contributed so far and ask what else is needed to become a maintainer.

**Step 5: Become a TSC Member**

Once you become a maintainer in one of the repositories, you can apply to join a group of [TSC members](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc).

Open a PR in the **community** repository to add your name to the [list of TSC members](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/TSC_MEMBERS.json). Specify your name, repositories that you maintain, and if you are sponsored by some company. For example [see this PR that introduced one of the new TSC members](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/277).
