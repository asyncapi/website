The prerequisite knowledge section highlights the key technologies, concepts, and skills our technical writers need for working with AsyncAPI documentation. You must understand the main concepts behind our documentation processes, content classification, and the AsyncAPI specification.

## Diátaxis framework and content buckets
AsyncAPI adopted the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework to meet our specific needs, classifying our documentation into content buckets (categories). 

- `Concepts` define the concepts of AsyncAPI features.
- `Tutorials` teach beginner processes with AsyncAPI by doing, taking you step-by-step from Point A to Point B.
- `Tools` documents the AsyncAPI tools ecosystem.
- `Guide` teaches troubleshooting and understanding AsyncAPI's capabilities at a high level.
- `Reference` documents the AsyncAPI specification.
- `Migration` guides how to upgrade to a newer AsyncAPI version.
- `Community` explains our documentation processes, guidelines, and resources to community members.

## Markdown syntax and `mermaid.js` diagrams
AsyncAPI's docs are written in [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

Our diagrams are created with [Mermaid markdown syntax](https://mermaid.live/) thanks to the [mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) dependency.

## AsyncAPI concepts
Before contributing to the documentation, you should understand [the purpose of AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/tutorials/getting-started) and essential [AsyncAPI concepts](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/concepts) _(i.e., servers, producers, consumers, channels, messages, etc.)_.

You should also fundamentally understand [the AsyncAPI specification](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/latest). 

## JSON and YAML
Because an AsyncAPI definition can be written in JSON and YAML, you must learn how to read, write, and validate these formats. 

## Understanding Event-Driven Architecture
[Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/tutorials/getting-started/event-driven-architectures/) uses events to trigger and communicate between services. (AsyncAPI is an open-source initiative that seeks to improve the current state of EDAs.) 

## Protocols used with AsyncAPI
AsyncAPI supports several protocols, such as Kafka, AMQP, MQTT, and more. You will benefit from acquiring a [basic understanding of protocols most used with AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/concepts/protocol), including their use cases and how they work with AsyncAPI.
