AsyncAPI Community uses Slack for real-time conversations. It helps us stay connected, ask questions, collaborate on issues, and learn from each other. Join us by following [this invitation](https://www.asyncapi.com/slack-invite/). Also, take a look at our community etiquette below to make sure you're on the right page.

As our community continues to expand, it's easy to forget that small habits like saying just "hi" before your actual message or sending multiple back-to-back replies can make conversations harder to follow. 

This guide outlines a few ways we can make Slack more respectful, organized, and inclusive for everyone.

You don't need to be perfect. These aren't hard rules, but they're good habits that help us collaborate better.

### Why etiquette matters

In our Slack workspace, most people contribute asynchronously, meaning your message might not be seen immediately. So, make sure it's clear, concise, and easy to respond to. Keeping threads organized, reducing noise, and respecting others' time helps create a space where everyone feels heard and informed.

Following Slack etiquette isn't just about being polite, but also, it helps build trust and maintain a respectful community. Disregarding these norms may lead to warnings or, in persistent cases, removal from the community. Respect people's time, especially during high-contributor periods like [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works). We're here to collaborate, not compete for attention.

### Tips for better Slack collaboration

* **Be specific and provide context:** Instead of just saying "hi", "I need help", or "anyone here?", make sure your message is clear and specific. This will help others understand what you're asking and provide better assistance.  
    > ❌ hi  
    > ✅ Hi! I'm trying to generate an AsyncAPI spec from a Kafka service using the CLI, but I'm stuck on config. My current config looks as follows: `<your-current-config>` Any tips?

* **Use threads for ongoing conversations:** Threads help keep topics organized and channels easier to browse. If someone replies to your question, respond in a thread unless they've already moved it elsewhere intentionally.

* **Minimize notification triggers:** Use `@channel`, `@here`, and `@everyone` only when necessary and permitted in the channel description. Instead of "+1" or "I agree" messages, use emoji reactions.

* **Prefer public channels:** Asking questions in public spaces makes it easier for others to learn from the conversation and builds a shared knowledge base. Avoid using direct messages unless the conversation is personal or private.

* **Use formatting to improve readability:** Break up long messages with paragraphs or bullet points. Use backticks (``) for code, bold for emphasis, and emojis to highlight sections.

* **Remove link previews:** When posting links, remove Slack's auto-generated previews unless they add useful context. This keeps conversations tidy.

* **Know your channels:** Channels with a `N_` prefix (e.g., `1_`, `10_`) are officially maintained. Contributors and maintainers are always encouraged to join them. If you need a dedicated channel for some discussion, feel free to create it but don't use numeric prefixes that are only allowed for officially maintained channels.

* **Respect focus and availability:** Contributors are spread across time zones and may be in meetings or deep work. If someone's in "Do Not Disturb" mode, Slack queues messages—there's no need to follow up immediately.

* **Mute wisely, not blindly:** If a channel is too noisy, you can mute it while still staying engaged. Use [keyword notifications](https://slack.com/help/articles/201355156-Configure-your-Slack-notifications#keyword-notifications) to get alerted when topics you care about (like `kafka`) are mentioned.

* **Be mindful of visual content:** Avoid using flashing, blinking, or flickering emojis and GIFs. These can be distracting and, worse, could trigger photosensitive epilepsy.

### How to ask questions thoughtfully

AsyncAPI Slack channels are like treasure havens full of mentors, contributors, and potential collaborators. Think of them as your audience - people who are eager to lend a hand but value clear communication.

Here's how to get the most out of them:

* **Be direct and descriptive:** Share context up front and explain what you're trying to do.
* **Choose the right channel:** Unsure where to post? Just ask. Avoid cross-posting the same question in multiple channels.
* **Don't fear "silly" questions:** As one mentor put it, "The only stupid question is the one that is not asked." You're here to learn.
* **Don't demand instant responses:** Everyone is volunteering their time. Be patient, and trust that help will come.

### What we value

Above all, our community values respectful, thoughtful conversation.

If you're ever unsure how to participate in a conversation or respond to a message, ask yourself: *Is my response clear, kind, and useful?* If it is, you're likely on the right track.
