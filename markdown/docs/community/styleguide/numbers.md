# Numbers Guidelines

## Numbers as Words/Numerals

1. Use numerals for numbers **10 and above**. Spell out numbers **zero through nine**.

   ### Examples

   - "Submit to _three_ repositories."
   - "A _10_-day conference"
   - "_Two_ messages"

2. Use numerals consistently in a sentence if the first number is greater than 10.

   ### Examples

   - "AsyncAPI has _21_ maintainers; _5_ are in charge of the CLI repository, _10_ manage the website repository, and _6_ handle other repositories."
   - "They fixed _12_ bugs today; _4_ in the morning, _6_ in the afternoon, and _2_ at night."

3. Spell out numbers when starting a sentence. Do **not** begin a sentence with a numeral.

   ### Examples

   - "_Seven_ free tickets are available for the conference."
   - "A _60_-year-old man."
   - "About _17_ community members voted for a change."
   - "_Six_ more people joined the meeting."

### Exceptions

1. You may mix words and numerals in a sentence if the numerals are significantly larger.

   - "We are running about twenty series of tests on 200,000 lines of code."

   Alternatively:

   - "We are running about 20 series of tests on 200,000 lines of code."

2. For estimations, you may spell out large values using "million" or "billion."

   - "The team has probably spent about a _million_ to maintain their infrastructure."
   - "Currently, general expenses are running into _billions_."

3. Use numerals for units of measurement, even for values less than 10.

   - "It will stretch up to _6km_ at most."
   - "Drink about _3ml_ of water every day."

4. Use the minus sign for negative numbers.

   - "-5"
   - "-300"

## Number Ranges

Use prepositions such as _from_ and _through_ or _to_, depending on the context. Use a hyphen for concise numeric ranges.

### Examples

- "_From_ 12 _through_ 20"
- "The meeting runs _from_ 2 PM _to_ 3 PM UTC."
- "Chapters 1â€“5"

## Ordinal Numbers

Ordinal numbers indicate position or order in a sequence (e.g., first, third, tenth).

Spell out ordinal numbers as words.

### Examples

- "I have submitted my _first_ task for this internship."
- "They will review the docs for the _tenth_ time today."

## Decimals

Always write decimals with a leading zero before the decimal point.

### Examples

- "0.3"
- "0.0021"

No need to spell out decimal numbers.

## Fractions

Use decimals when possible. If using written fractions, spell them out using a hyphen between the numerator and denominator.

### Examples

- "We have covered _one-third_ of this documentation."
- "We have set up _two-thirds_ of our infrastructure."

## Currency

Use the currency symbol followed by the value. If multiple countries use the same symbol (e.g., dollars), include the country code acronym.

### Examples

- "$10 USD"
- "$10 CAD"
- "$5 AUD"

You do not need to spell out currency values, even if they are less than 10.

## Commas in Numbers

Use commas for numbers **five digits and above**.

### Examples

- "2000"
- "88,000"

### Exceptions

Do not use commas in numbers for pages, weather values, addresses, and similar cases.

#### Examples

- "pg. _24567_"
- "SW _1015_"
- "Grovel Park, _10067E_"

## Abbreviations

You may abbreviate units of measurement (e.g., km, px, cl), but avoid abbreviating large numbers such as "million" or "billion."

### Examples

- "It has about 3px camera quality."
- "They have spent about $30 million on storage costs alone."
- "There are about a billion lines of code in the codebase. You cannot read everything."

## Percentages

Use the percentage symbol (%) after numerals. If starting a sentence, spell out the percentage.

### Examples

- "_Forty percent_ of the files have been recovered."
- "About _40%_ of the files have been recovered."

## Phone Numbers

When writing phone numbers, include the country code and separate the sections with hyphens.

### Examples

- "+234-81-233-679-21"
- "+256-81-233-877-90"

> **Note:** Unless entering personal information on a secure platform, always use example phone numbers when creating content.

## Date and Time

### Date

When writing dates with numerals, use the **YYYY/MM/DD** format. When writing in words, use the **Month Day, Year** format with a comma before the year.

#### Examples

- "2025/04/21"
- "April 21, 2025"

### Time

Always indicate a general time zone (e.g., UTC). Use the 12-hour format where appropriate.

#### Examples

- "11:00 AM (UTC)"
- "3:15 PM (UTC)"
