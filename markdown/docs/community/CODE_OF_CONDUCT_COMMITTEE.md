# AsyncAPI Code of Conduct Committee

## Purpose

The AsyncAPI Code of Conduct Committee (CoC Committee) is a committee that responds to investigates, and resolves [AsyncAPI Code of Conduct](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) incidents.

The members of the CoC Committee are members of the [Technical Steering Committee](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc) (TSC) [voted](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/682#discussioncomment-7498209) publicly by the community. The committee has a two-year term, after which re-election will take place.

## Members

The AsyncAPI CoC Committee consists of 3 full members and 3 alternate members:

**Full Members**:

- [Aishat Muibudeen](https://github.com/mayaleeeee)
- [Azeez Elegbede](https://github.com/acethecreator)
- [Sergio Moya](https://github.com/smoya)

**Alternate Members:** 

- [Alejandra Quetzalli](https://github.com/alequetzalli)
- [Thulisile Sibanda](https://github.com/thulieblack)

If one of the CoC members listed above is unavailable or has to recuse themselves from participating in the resolution of a CoC incident due to a conflict of interest (see our [Conflict of Interest policy](COC-incident-resolution-procedures#conflicts-of-interest)), AsyncAPI may request assistance from the [Technical Steering Committee](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc) in appointing an alternate from the TSC members to take their place for that incident.

## How Decisions Are Made

Decisions of the CoC Committee shall be made by consensus whenever possible.  In the event consensus cannot be reached, decisions shall be made by majority vote of non-conflicted members of the CoC Committee.  A decision to take temporary interim action in the event of an emergency may be taken by any individual CoC Committee member acting in good faith, and the CoC Committee shall review such action and decide whether to confirm or reverse such action.  Any permanent action shall require approval of a majority of non-conflicted members of the CoC Committee.  The CoC Committee may take action without a meeting if a majority of non-conflicted members express agreement in writing (e.g., email or Slack) and none of the non-conflicted CoC Committee members either object to the proposed action or request a meeting to discuss the proposed action within 24 hours after the action is first proposed to the CoC Committee. In the absence of such agreement in writing, the CoC Committee may only take action during or after a meeting takes place at which the proposed action is discussed and agreed to by consensus or voted upon by a quorum of the non-conflicted members.  A majority of non-conflicted members shall be deemed a quorum for purposes of a meeting.  See the [Conflict of Interest](COC-incident-resolution-procedures#conflicts-of-interest) section of the Incident Resolution Procedures for more information.
