## Introduction

The AsyncAPI Community has always been about collaboration, innovation, and knowledge-sharing. To further strengthen our ecosystem, we’re thrilled to introduce the "AsyncAPI Webinar Series" — a platform where experts, enthusiasts, and contributors can come together to discuss everything related to event-driven architectures, messaging protocols, and AsyncAPI best practices. Whether you're new to AsyncAPI or a seasoned professional, this series is designed to bring valuable insights and engaging discussions straight to you.

## Why We Are Doing This

As AsyncAPI continues to evolve, we recognize the need for more interactive and accessible learning opportunities. While documentation, blog posts, and conferences are great, webinars offer a real-time, engaging format where participants can ask questions, share experiences, and gain deeper insights into the AsyncAPI ecosystem.

Our goals include:
- Educating developers and architects on the latest in event-driven APIs.
- Inspiring new contributors and companies to adopt and improve AsyncAPI.
- Connecting the global community through meaningful conversations.

## Why You Should Attend

By joining our webinars, you’ll get:
- Direct access to industry experts sharing best practices and real-world use cases.
- Live Q&A sessions to ask burning questions and get immediate insights.
- Networking opportunities with like-minded developers and community members.
- Exclusive content and demos that go beyond written documentation.

## Why You Should Speak

Are you working on something exciting related to AsyncAPI? Do you have a unique perspective on event-driven architectures? This is your chance to:
- Share your expertise with a global audience.
- Boost your visibility within the AsyncAPI community.
- Contribute to the open-source ecosystem by educating and inspiring others.
- Get feedback and ideas to refine your approach and solutions.

## Benefits of the Webinar Series

- For Attendees: Learning, skill-building, and networking opportunities.
- For Speakers: Exposure, recognition, and a platform to share ideas.
- For the Community: A growing knowledge base, increased collaboration, and a more vibrant ecosystem.

## How It Works

Each webinar will be streamed live (via Restream) on AsyncAPI’s YouTube channel and promoted via our community channels. Sessions typically last 45–60 minutes, including:

- A brief introduction
- The main talk or demo
- A live Q&A
- Closing announcements

Sessions are held monthly or bi-monthly based on availability of speakers and community demand.

## Host & Speaker Alignment Process

Before each session, it’s essential that the host and speaker connect to align on the webinar’s objectives, key results, and flow. This coordination ensures a smooth experience for the audience and maximizes the value of the session.

Alignment Steps:

1. Intro Call/Sync (One month before the session)
Schedule a 30-minute call between the host and speaker to:

- Discuss the topic’s relevance and audience expectations.
- Align on the webinar objectives and desired outcomes.
- Review the format and Q&A flow.
- Go over any technical or content needs (demos, slides, etc.).

2. Share the Webinar Planning Template
A shared planning doc helps both parties stay on track. It includes:

- Speaker bio and headshot
- Session title and abstract
- Key takeaways
- Slide/demo links
- Tech requirements and backup plans
- Promotional blurbs and hashtags

3. Final Check-in (1–2 days before the session)
A short async or live check-in to confirm everything is ready:

- Slides/demos are ready
- Tech check passed
- Socials are scheduled
- Everyone knows the schedule
