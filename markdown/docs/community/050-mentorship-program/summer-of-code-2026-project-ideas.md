## FAQ

1. **How active are previous GSoC contributors in AsyncAPI?** AsyncAPI participated in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) for the fourth time in 2025, a significant milestone that speaks to our commitment to nurturing the next generation of open-source contributors. Many contributors from that cohort remain actively involved in the community, while some ended up as project maintainers, including:

   - **[Adi Boghawala](https://github.com/Adi-204)**: Now a maintainer of the [AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator) repository
   - **[Ruchi Pakhle](https://github.com/Ruchip16)**: Currently maintaining and advocating for the [AsyncAPI VsCode Extension](https://github.com/asyncapi/vs-asyncapi-preview)
   - **[Tenz Delek](https://github.com/TenzDelek)**: Active contributor and triager on the [AsyncAPI Conference Website](https://github.com/asyncapi/conference-website)
