# Google Summer of Code - Getting Started

###### Introduction

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual program sponsored by Google that offers stipends to contributors for working on open-source projects during the summer. Contributors gain real-world software development experience by working with mentors from participating organizations. The goal is to encourage developers to contribute to open-source projects and improve their coding skills. If you want to develop open-source software, this program is for you! 

AsyncAPI is looking for contributors who are eager to learn, have good coding abilities, and, most importantly, have a strong passion for APIs and open-source development. 


### Requirement

Successful GSoC contributors will receive [compensation](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends) for their contributions.

To be eligible as a contributor, you must be at least 18 years old at the time of registration and be new to open-source projects. Group applications are not permitted. 

Please verify your eligibility by visiting the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) website.](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started)

TL;DR: GSoC exclusively focuses on coding projects. While initiatives like documentation or design are valuable, they are not permitted within the scope of GSoC. You can check out the AsyncAPI Mentorship Program or GSoD for other noncoding-related projects.

### First Steps

- **The ideal starting point is [Google's Student Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student)**!
  Carefully read through the guide to familiarize yourself with the initiative. The guide provides a comprehensive program overview and offers valuable advice on starting communication, proposal writing, and beginning your work. Additionally, [refer to Google's FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) for more information.

- **Get familiar with the AsyncAPI project.**
  Please be sure to familiarize yourself with the AsyncAPI initiative and its mission and [get involved in the community](https://asyncapi.com/slack-invite). Explore the [AsyncAPI projects](https://github.com/asyncapi), get an idea of the project of your interest, and explore the source code and organization of the project.

- **Write your project proposal.**
  Visit the [ideas page](./summerofcode-2024-asyncapi-gsoc-ideas-page) to choose a topic that catches your interest. You can also draw inspiration from projects from previous years.
  
  We recommend reading [Google's guide for writing a proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

  For feedback, submit your work early! However, due to the influx of applications, feedback may only be available during the final week after the deadline.
