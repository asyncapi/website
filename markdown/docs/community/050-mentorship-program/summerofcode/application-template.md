# GSoC Application Template

This is the AsyncAPI Project's Google Summer of Code Application Template. We made it to assist contributors in crafting impressive proposals that will impress us. You can submit a draft proposal early to get feedback and iterate early. Be sure to read [Google's guide to writing a proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal)

Here's what we want to hear from you:

### Contact information

Please provide your most basic contact information, such as:
- Full name
- Email address
- GitHub handle
- Contact Number(include your country code)

### Project Information

This section is for you to provide all your understanding of the project, such as:
- What is the aim of your project, and what problem does it aim to address?
- Providing a detailed description of the proposed project. Here's where to add technical explanations, architectural diagrams, or design mockups.
- What will the outcome of your project be at the end of the program?
- How do you plan to finish the project on schedule? For instance, what are the important milestones, and what is your approximate timeline for reaching them?
- What qualities should a suitable mentor for your project possess?

### Your Understanding of AsyncAPI

AsyncAPI is an initiative with many projects and design patterns. In this section, we assess your familiarity with AsyncAPI. We encourage seasoned users and newcomers to explore and understand AsyncAPI during the application phase.

- Please share your background as an AsyncAPI user or contributor, or if you're new to AsyncAPI, outline your intentions for learning AsyncAPI. 
- If you've submitted bug fixes or patches to any of our projects before, please provide links to the repositories for one or more examples of your work with AsyncAPI.
- Please explain your knowledge of the AsyncAPI development infrastructure and Git(a plus if it's for your chosen project). If you're unfamiliar with them, what do you plan to learn? We'd like to encourage you to use the application period to familiarize yourself with these tools.
-   Include or share links to a sample of code unrelated to AsyncAPI demonstrating your development abilities(Optional).

### Your Involvement with the AsyncAPI community

We welcome applications from folks new to AsyncAPI. If you have previous experience with the AsyncAPI community, please share it. We encourage newcomers to use this application period to get involved with the AsyncAPI community.

- How long have you been engaged with the AsyncAPI community? For instance, have you attended community meetings, contributed to the website, or participated in AsyncAPI events in any capacity?
- Have you developed and released any project or offered support or services (voluntary or commercial) to AsyncAPI users independently from the official AsyncAPI project?
- If you have not engaged with the AsyncAPI community, what are your plans for getting involved?
- What are your intentions for contributing to AsyncAPI besides your project work? Do you anticipate continuing your involvement with AsyncAPI after finishing your project? If yes, how do you plan to do so?
