# GSoC Mentor's Guideline

##### Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) mentors' guideline. As a mentor, you are crucial in guiding and supporting contributors throughout their GSoC journey. This guideline outlines key responsibilities, best practices, and tips to ensure a successful mentoring experience.

### Key Responsibilities

To participate in the Program, mentors must be contributors or maintainers to any project run by AsyncAPI and not be a participant in the Program. Here are some key responsibilities we expect from our mentors.

- You'll need to provide guidance, support, and direction to your GSoC contributors throughout the project timeline. It's important to encourage collaboration among GSoC contributors and mentors as well. You'll also need to set reasonable expectations and clearly define project goals, milestones, and expectations at the beginning of the Program.

- Regular communication is also essential. You'll need to communicate effectively with your contributors through preferred channels such as email, Slack, or video calls. Be readily available and responsive to GSoC contributors' questions, concerns, and requests for assistance. Remember to review code submissions, provide constructive feedback, and help contributors improve their coding skills.

- Please also encourage contributors to engage with the AsyncAPI community, attend meetings, seek help from fellow community members, and encourage them to share their achievements and milestones with the rest of the community. Make sure that project documentation is up-to-date and accessible for reference to interested contributors.
### Contributors Selection Process

When it comes to selecting contributors for GSoC, there are a few things you should consider as a mentor:

- You must ensure their proposal aligns well with the project goals, objectives, and requirements. Assess their technical skills and proficiency in relevant programming languages, tools, and technologies required for the project. And don't hesitate to interview candidates if you need to be more convinced by their proposals.

- You'll need to assess communication skills, responsiveness, and the ability to collaborate effectively with mentors and the community. These are also important points to consider. You should also evaluate the interested GSoC contributor's commitment level, availability, and willingness to dedicate time and effort to the project throughout the Program. Look at past contributions, code submissions, or involvement in open-source projects to scale the GSoC contributor's experience and dedication to the community.

### Conclusion

Thank you for your dedication and commitment as a GSoC mentor. Your guidance and support are invaluable in helping contributors succeed and contribute to AsyncAPI. Best of luck for a productive and rewarding GSoC mentoring experience!
