# AsyncAPI Ideas Page: Google Summer of Code 2024
Welcome to the **AsyncAPI Ideas Page** with our proposed projects for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024! If you are an interested student/contributor, please don't hesitate to contact our mentors directly to discuss project ideas.

## 1) [Autofix for Spectral Linting Errors: VS Code Extension](https://github.com/asyncapi/vs-asyncapi-preview/issues/160)
Enhance the [AsyncAPI Preview + Spectral](https://github.com/asyncapi/vs-asyncapi-preview) VS Code extension by introducing an autofix feature. This improvement aims to streamline the editing experience by automatically resolving common Spectral linting errors directly within the IDE.

- 🎯 **Outcome:** Automate corrections for standard spectral linting issues in AsyncAPI documents. [Learn more](https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/1e63ffd0220f3-async-api-rules).
- 🛠️ **Skills Required:** TypeScript/JavaScript and understanding of Spectral rules.
- 🧩 **Difficulty:** Easy/Medium

Upgrade the [AsyncAPI Preview](https://github.com/asyncapi/vs-asyncapi-preview) VS Code extension to include a feature for visualizing message payloads through Markdown and MermaidJS Class Diagrams. It also incorporates an export feature for the Markdown preview to facilitate its use in external documentation. This enhancement will work with both AsyncAPI schemas and Avro (.avsc) files to offer a dynamic and interactive view of message structures.
