## 2022 participation

AsyncAPI was a [successful participant in Season of Docs (GSoD) 2022](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/2022/participants)!

### ⌛ Timeline
The GSoD program runs for almost 6 months.

In 2022, GSoD at AsyncAPI had 2 projects and we hired 6 Technical Writers (TW).

The timeline ran as follows:
- **May:** TWs received orientation on contributing to AsyncAPI Initiative, how Docs issues are organized, and assigned good `first-time-tickets` to get each new TW contributor started. 
- **June - August:**	Each TW went through designated issues marked for both first-time contributors and work set aside for `GSoD 2022`. Each TW started creating documentation for their issues assigned/selected. 
- **September - October:** We determined if we could complete both projects. We re-aligned priorities as needed and assessed what is missing to reach our 2022 IA update goals for AsyncAPI Docs.
- **November-mid December:**	Project completed, and all contributors received some swag! 


### 💸 Project budget
We had 2 mentors for our 2 projects: improving our IA and re-structuring our Generator Docs. AsyncAPI requested from Google a US $5000 budget for each project. For both projects, the request then totaled a $10,000 budget.  

| **Budget item**                                                                                      | **Total Amount** |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Technical writer updates, reviews, edits, and publishing new documentation for the IA improvements.  | $5000            |
| Technical writer updates, reviews, migration, and publishing improved Generator tool documentation.  | $5000            |
| **TOTAL**                 | $10,000            |
