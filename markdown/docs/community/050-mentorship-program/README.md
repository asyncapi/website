# AsyncAPI Mentoring Initiatives

The AsyncAPI Initiative participates in a variety of mentoring programs. AsyncAPI is a great place to spend a summer learning, coding, participating, and contributing. We are an exciting open-source foundation with a vibrant community of projects, and we look forward to your application and project ideas!

## Organization Admins
If you need help with anything mentoring at AsyncAPI, join AsyncAPI on Slack and navigate to the mentorship channel and reach out.

Organization admins for specific mentorship programs are listed on the program's respective pages.

## Communication

Please contact us using the [AsyncAPI Discussions boards](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/discussions).

We are also available on the [AsyncAPI slack](https://asyncapi.com/slack-invite). Please don't use DMs unless strictly necessary, as doing so can potentially overwhelm project maintainers, and others with similar questions lose the benefit of public discussion.
