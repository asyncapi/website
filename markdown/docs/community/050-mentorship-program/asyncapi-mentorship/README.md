The AsyncAPI initiative hosts the AsyncAPI mentorship program, an industry standard for defining asynchronous APIs.

## Definitions 

  - "**Acceptance Date**" means the date accepted project proposals are announced. 
  - "**Execution Period**" means the period designated for participants to complete their projects.
  - "**Community Bonding Period**" means the period for accepted participants to get to know their Mentors and prepare to begin work on their Project.
  - "**Evaluation Period**" means the period where the Mentor gives an assessment of the Participant's progress so far during the Program.
  - "**Final Phase**" means the final half of the Execution period of a given project.
  - "**Final Project Material**" means a Participants final source code/design file and associated documentation for their Project.
  - "**AsyncAPI Mentee**" means the individual who applies for the Program as an AsyncAPI Contributor.
  - "**Idea List**" means the list of ideas for Projects publicly published by the Organization.
  - "**Members**" means the Organization Administrators and Mentors.
  - "**Phase 1**" means the first half of the Execution Period of a given Project.
  - "**Program Administrators**" means AsyncAPI's administrators for the Program.
  - "**Program Period**" is between January 23, 2023, and November 17, 2023.
  - **Project**" means an open-source project to be worked on by an AsyncAPI's Contributor as an individual. To avoid doubt, projects aren't just coding-related.
  - "**Project Proposal**" means an AsyncAPI contributor's proposal for a project.
  - "**Project Submissions**" means the work product that an AsyncAPI Contributor submits for a Project, including the Project Proposal and any software and documentation, including Final Project Materials.

## Program Administration

#### Changes to the Program
AsyncAPI may suspend, cancel, or modify the Program's structure if technical difficulties or events beyond AsyncAPI's reasonable control prevent or make it unfair to run the Program in accordance with these Program Rules.
 
#### Program Removal
In addition to any terms regarding removal from the Program stated in these Program Rules, AsyncAPI may remove a Participant from the Program if AsyncAPI reasonably believes that the Participant has attempted to undermine the legitimate operation of the Program, including:
- Breaching or refusing to comply with these Program Rules
- Stressing the Mentor by not being responsive or not keeping the Mentor in the loop during the program period
- Threatening or harassing AsyncAPI or other Participants, including Organizations' employees and representatives
- Tampering or interfering with the administration of the Program or with the ability of other Participants to participate in the Program
- Submitting content that is not original/violates the rights of a third party/lewd, obscene, pornographic, racist, sexist, or otherwise inappropriate to the Program.
- Suppose a Participant is removed from the Program for any reason. In that case, the Participant will no longer be eligible to receive stipends from AsyncAPI and may be prohibited from participating in any future programs run by the AsyncAPI Initiative. 

#### Communication
All communications between AsyncAPI and the Participants, including Github, Slack, and email, will be in English.

#### Conduct
Participants must behave professionally and courteously when interacting with other Participants and Program Administrators. If a Participant does not behave professionally and courteously, AsyncAPI may remove the Participant from the Program.

## Mentors
The Organization's Administrator must designate mentors. 
  
#### Eligibility
To participate in the Program, mentors must be contributors or maintainers to any project run by AsyncAPI and not be participants in the Program.

#### Responsibilities
Each Mentor for an accepted project will:
- Participate in the Community Bonding Period
- Guide their Contributor(s) on their Projects for the Organization
- Use best efforts to respond to Contributor requests within forty-eight (48) hours.
- Provide Evaluations of their Contributor(s)'’' work by the Project Criteria

Suppose AsyncAPI reasonably believes that a Mentor still needs to meet the primary responsibilities. In that case, AsyncAPI may require the Progam Administrators to designate a replacement Mentor and remove the former Mentor from the Program.

## Program Contributors/Mentees

#### Eligibility 
To qualify to participate in the AsyncAPI mentorship program, you have to meet the following criteria:
- Made at least two contributions to any of the AsyncAPI's projects.
- Be a student or a beginner in open-source software development.
- Not be a Project Administrator or Mentor in the Program
- Only participated in the Program once.

#### How To Apply
Ensure you're eligible to participate in the Program, then submit a Project Proposal to the project mentor during the application period described in the Program Timeline.

#### Project Proposals
- Project Proposals must be for Projects on the Organization's Ideas List.
- If a Project Proposal is for a Project already being worked on by a contributor, note that any work done on the Project before Acceptance of the Project Proposal will not be considered for Evaluation.
- Each AsyncAPI Contributor may submit up to three (3) Project Proposals; however, only one (1) Project Proposal may be accepted per AsyncAPI Contributor.

#### Acceptance
- Project Proposals will be reviewed by the selected project Mentor to which they were submitted. A Mentor may accept or reject any Project Proposal at their sole discretion. If two (2) mentors wish to accept Project Proposals from the same Contributor, the Contributor will decide only to select one Project of their choice. AsyncAPI will announce the Project Proposals accepted to the Program on the Program Slack channel and in the GitHub discussion.
- Each Contributor with an accepted Project Proposal will be matched with at least one (1) Mentor.
- To continue with the program, Contributors must have an accepted Project Proposal, and they will have to try again next time.

#### Responsibilities

Each accepted AsyncAPI mentorship participant will perform all necessary additional steps required for them to participate in the Program, including:
- Participating in the Community Bonding Period
- Providing Evaluation of their Mentor
- Working diligently to complete the Project as it may be modified with the agreement of the Organization
- Following the coding and documentation standards set out by their Organization
- Actively participating in the Organization's community and adhering to the Organization's rules and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Publishing their Project code in a publicly accessible location and under an [Open Source Initiative approved license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) of the Organization's choice.

If AsyncAPI reasonably believes that a Participant has failed to meet the primary responsibilities, AsyncAPI may remove such Participant from the Program.

## Program Participation

#### Evaluations
- **Multiple Mentors**: If a Participant has more than one(1) mentor:
    - The Participant is only required to submit an overall Evaluation of the Mentor.
    - Only one(1) Mentor is required to submit an Evaluation of the Participant.
- **Form**: Evaluations must be in the form of a private response to the program administrator's questions
- **Deadlines**: Participants and Mentors must submit Evaluations to the program administrators through the appropriate channel by the agreed deadlines set forth by both parties before the start date 
- **Visibility**: Evaluations submitted by a Participant will only be visible to the Program Administrators
- **Grading; Missing Deadlines**: 
    - If the Participant receives a failing grade on the Phase 1 Evaluation period, the Participant will be removed from the Program.
    - The Mentor will evaluate the Participant's Project Submissions based on the work done from the beginning of the work period until the start of the evaluation period. Any work done during the evaluation period will be considered for the next evaluation period.
    - The Mentor will evaluate the Participant's Project Submissions against the Project Criteria.
    - If a Mentor fails to submit an Evaluation by the applicable deadline, the Participant will not receive the stipend for that Evaluation period.
- **Final Project Materials**: AsyncAPI mentorship program Participants must submit their Final Project Materials through the Organization Github account by the Final Evaluation deadline. If a participant fails to do so, the Participant will be deemed to have received a failing grade on the Final Evaluation, regardless of the actual grade the Participant received from the Mentor.


## Payment

The AsyncAPI participants may receive stipends from AsyncAPI, which are at AsyncAPI's sole discretion and are not adjusted to the cost of living. All participants will receive an equal amount of stipends during the program participation. 

- To qualify for a stipend, each participant must pass both the Phase 1 and Final Phase Evaluation and complete all required tasks.
- Stipends will be issued by the last day of each month to participants who receive passing evaluations from their mentor for that month.

AsyncAPI is not required to pay any stipends to any Participant who violates any applicable regulation.
