### Ideas list

Number | Idea | Area | Lead Mentor | Scope
:---:|---|:---:|:---:|---
1 | [Enhancing Developer Experience in CLI](https://github.com/asyncapi/cli/issues/15) | AsyncAPI CLI | [Aayush Saini](https://github.com/AayushSaini101) | Validate an AsyncAPI file against custom spectral rules & sync my local AsyncAPI file with a remote system (e.g registry). Publish my AsyncAPI file in a schema registry and render AsyncAPI documentation. Fix test cases, we cannot execute test cases directly in the CLI and remaining DX issues in CLI Board.
2 | [AI-Powered AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1361#discussioncomment-10505262) | [AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator) | [Azeez Elegbede](https://github.com/AceTheCreator) | Create an AI-based extension for the AsyncAPI Generator that automatically generates initial AsyncAPI specifications from natural language descriptions or existing API documentation. Leveraging NLP models, this tool can take user-provided requirements and convert them into accurate AsyncAPI specs.
3 | [Becoming a Maintainer of AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1361#discussioncomment-10520123) | [AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator) | [Lukasz Gornicki](https://github.com/derberg) | This initiative aims to guide you on a journey from being a contributor to becoming a maintainer of the project. You'll gain insight into the responsibilities of a maintainer, involving tasks beyond mere coding. Goal is same as [GSoC.](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/issues/1145)
4 | [Performance + Accessibility Improvement of website](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/issues/3186) | [AsyncAPI website](https://github.com/asyncapi/website) | [Sambhav Gupta](https://github.com/sambhavgupta0705) |With the addition of multiple components, pages and MD files, it's now important for us to make the website efficient for all web + mobile users. Currently, the performance of the website has critically low numbers in both web and mobile view, which can impact the efficiency and user views in the website. On the other hand, it's also important that we add the necessary accessibility labels to the website. 
5 | [Migration of build + workflow scripts to typescript](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/issues/3187) | [AsyncAPI website](https://github.com/asyncapi/website) | [Ansh Goyal](https://github.com/anshgoyalevil) | With the current package.json built for ES modules and packages, as we migrated the website to Next js 14 + Typescript, it has now started affecting the scripts folder like working of meetings workflow, automation of blog creation using npm script, etc. Since, to have uniformity across the website, we decided to migrate the existing Node js scripts to common js modules (in Typescript), enhancing the code maintenance, scalability, and readability for contributors.
6 | [User Research + Usability Testing on the AsyncAPI Website](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/issues/529) | User Research | [Aishat Muibudeen](https://github.com/Mayaleeeee) | It would be beneficial if we were to start performing usability tests across our tools periodically to help us gather data that could lead to more grounded ideas for design improvements. Create a new page on the website that can explain the process of being a participant in a user research study and steps to get involved. And because we are open source, this page could also attract an audience of other product designers looking to make open source contributions or to maybe gain experience conducting a user research study. 
7 | [Holopin Design Project](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/1306) | Design | [Aishat Muibudeen](https://github.com/Mayaleeeee)|This project aims to create visually appealing and user-friendly digital badges for our community, ensuring alignment with AsyncAPI's branding and easy recognizability. The goal is to recognize member contributions and creating a vibrant, active community with Holopin’s digital badges.
