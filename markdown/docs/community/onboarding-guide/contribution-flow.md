# Simple Contribution Flow
This guide explains how to contribute effectively to AsyncAPI. It guides you through the contribution process and provides a checklist to ensure high-quality contributions. 

## Making a Contribution
We welcome your contributions to AsyncAPI, whether you have suggestions, improvements, or new ideas. 

At AsyncAPI, we value **quality over quantity**. This guide will help you make meaningful contributions that benefit the community.

### Before You Start Contributing
- If you are joining AsyncAPI through [Slack](https://asyncapi.com/slack-invite) or an event, take your time to explore the [AsyncAPI website](https://www.asyncapi.com/).  
- Read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  
- [Attend meetings](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/events) and engage in discussions in the [`#11_contributing` Slack channel](https://asyncapi.com/slack-invite).
- Read the [documentation](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs) to learn more about AsyncAPI.

### Before Making a Contribution
- Read the [onboarding contributor guide](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/community/onboarding-guide).
- If you are contributing to the community repository, review the [documentation onboarding checklist](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/community/onboarding-guide/docs-onboarding-checklist). 
- For other repositories, refer to the [general contribution guidelines](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Look through existing issues and pull requests to understand the repository better.
- Check the [general roadmap](https://www.asyncapi.com/roadmap).

### Steps to making a good contribution
1. Set up your workflow environment using the [git workflow guide](/asyncapi/community/blob/master/git-workflow.md).
2. Search for [good first issues](https://github.com/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aopen+org%3Aasyncapi+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). 
3. When you find one, comment on your interest and share the approach to solving the issue (please don't ask to be assigned, as it could be flagged as spam).
4. If you noticed a bug, typo, or needed improvement, feel free to create an issue.
5. **Make a PR only after a maintainer assigned the issue to you or asks you to work on it** even if you created the issue yourself.
6. Follow the [conventional commits guide](conventional-commits) to write a good PR title.
7. Follow the [git workflow document](/asyncapi/community/blob/master/git-workflow.md) when working on your changes and making a PR.
8. After making a PR, patiently wait for reviews.
9. Make sure all your PR checks pass (turn green) to speed up the merging process.  
10. If your PR hasn‚Äôt been reviewed after **a week and a half**, you can gently remind a maintainer on Slack or GitHub. Delays can happen for various reasons, but no one is ignoring you! üôèüèº .

## Important Contribution Rules
To help maintain a welcoming and productive environment, we have outlined a few important contribution rules that all contributors, especially new ones, must follow.

These rules are here to help you succeed and to support the maintainers and community as we all work together. Not following them can lead to consequences, such as being blocked from submitting PRs or being removed from the community.

### ‚úÖ What You Should Always Do

- **Be patient**. Maintainers are volunteers with their jobs, families, and responsibilities. It may take time for your PR or issue to be reviewed.
- **Use the right Slack channels**. If you're unsure where to post, ask politely or take a moment to check.
- **Keep Slack tidy**. Use threads for conversations, avoid tagging `@maintainers` unless truly necessary, and don‚Äôt spam.
-  Follow our [Slack etiquette](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/slack-etiquette.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- **Respect others**. Treat everyone with kindness and patience. We are all here to learn and grow together.

### ‚ùå What You Should Never Do
- Ignore essential onboarding materials and contribution guidelines.
- Tag maintainers repeatedly or demand attention.
- Post the same message in multiple places.
- Expect instant replies.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Happens If You Break the Rules

We're friendly and welcoming, but we also value focus and respect. If rules are ignored:

- You may be muted or temporarily removed from Slack.
- Repeated behavior could lead to permanent removal from the community.
- PRs or issues may be closed or rejected if the behavior affects maintainers or the community.

These rules are not meant to scare anyone - they're here to make sure everyone can enjoy a healthy and respectful space. When in doubt, be thoughtful, ask questions politely, and refer to our onboarding and etiquette docs.

Let's keep AsyncAPI a community where people enjoy contributing. üëèüèº
