# Contributor Guide to Upholding the Code of Conduct

Welcome to the AsyncAPI community! As a contributor, you are an essential part of building a safe, inclusive, and respectful environment for everyone. This guide will help you understand how to follow and uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).



## Why This Matters

The Code of Conduct (CoC) sets expectations for behavior in all AsyncAPI spaces, including repositories, GitHub discussions, communication platforms (such as Slack), and online and physical events. 

Following it helps:

- Foster inclusion and belonging
- Prevent and resolve conflicts
- Protect the well-being of all contributors



## Your Responsibilities as a Contributor

- **Be Respectful:** Treat others with kindness and professionalism.
- **Be Inclusive:** Welcome diverse perspectives and backgrounds.
- **Be community-oriented:** Encourage collaboration, help others when you can, and gracefully accept constructive criticism.
- **Speak Up:** If you witness inappropriate behavior, report it.

You are expected to read and understand the full [CoC](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.


## What to Do If You Experience or Witness a Violation

If you experience or observe discrimination, harassment, or any behavior that violates the CoC:

### 1. Document What Happened
- Note what was said or done
- Include context (e.g., link to a GitHub issue, Slack conversation)
- If possible, take a screenshot

### 2. Report the Incident
You can report a CoC violation by:

- Emailing **conduct@asyncapi.io** â€“ this forwards directly to the [Code of Conduct Committee](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/code_of_conduct/code-of-conduct-committee.md)
- Reaching out to a specific CoC Committee member if the issue involves someone on the committee

All reports are handled with confidentiality, respect, and prompt action.


## Conflict Resolution

Not all disagreements are violations. When conflicts happen:

- First, try a respectful discussion or ask a neutral contributor to help mediate.
- If the situation escalates or becomes hostile, report the issue to the CoC Committee.

The Code of Conduct Committee is trained to resolve conflicts fairly and ensure everyone feels safe.
