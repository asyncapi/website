## Documentation formatting

### Notes and warning blocks

Notes and warning blocks are used to draw attention to important information. Use the following markdown features when necessary:

- Use a clear and concise heading to introduce the note or warning.
- Use short paragraphs or bullet points to convey the information.
- Keep the language simple and direct.
- Use an `>` in markdown to indicate the nature of the note or warning. 
- Use the following Use the following syntax to apply a style. Currently our documenation supports **Remember** `<Remember>`:
  * Surround the text with an opening and closing tag.
  * Use the following syntax to apply a style:
` <Remember> 
No need to add a prefix (Remember); the tag automatically provides one
</Remember>`

The output: 

<Remember> 
No need to add a prefix (Remember); the tag automatically provides one
</Remember>
