      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re coming from OpenAPI, you must know that AsyncAPI started as an adaptation of the OpenAPI specification. We wanted to have as much compatibility as possible between the two so users could reuse parts in both.
You&amp;rsquo;ll find lots of similarities between OpenAPI and AsyncAPI. Just bear in mind that, in the world of event-driven architectures, we have more than one protocol and therefore some things are different. Check out the following comparison chart, inspired by Darrel Miller&amp;rsquo;s blog post:</description>

      <description>An AsyncAPI document is a file that defines and annotates the different components of a specific Event-Driven API.
The format of the file must be JSON or YAML, however, only the subset of YAML that matches the JSON capabilities is allowed.
asyncapi: &amp;#39;2.0.0&amp;#39; id: &amp;#39;urn:com.my-application.example&amp;#39; info: title: Example version: 0.1.0 channels: user/signedup: subscribe: message: description: An event describing that a user just signed up. payload: type: object additionalProperties: false properties: fullName: type: string email: type: string format: email age: type: integer minimum: 18 The AsyncAPI document is a machine-readable definition of your event-driven API.</description>

      <description>An API Strategist Explores Event-Driven APIs If you’re like me and have experience with web services and the paradigm of RESTful, web services, and SOAP APIs, but curious about event-driven, message based, or streaming APIs, this article is for you.
I virtually sat down with these experts:
 Fran Mendez, Founder of AsyncAPI
 Jonathan Schabowsky, Chief Architect, Solace
 David McKenna, SVP, Research &amp;amp; Development, Axway
 Eric Horesnyi, General Manager, APIs &amp;amp; Integration, Axway (CEO of Streamdata.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s define an application that&amp;rsquo;s capable of receiving a &amp;ldquo;hello {name}&amp;rdquo; message.
asyncapi: 2.0.0 info: title: Hello world application version: &#39;0.1.0&#39; channels: hello: publish: message: payload: type: string pattern: &#39;^hello .+$&#39;  Let&amp;rsquo;s get into the details of the sample specification:

      <description>In the previous lesson, we learned how to create the definition of a simple Hello World application, so let&amp;rsquo;s take it from there.
In this article, we will learn how to add &amp;ldquo;servers&amp;rdquo; to our AsyncAPI document. Adding and defining servers is useful because it specifies where and how to connect. The connection facilitates where to send and receive messages.
asyncapi: 2.0.0 info: title: Hello world application version: &amp;#39;0.1.0&amp;#39; servers: production: url: broker.</description>

      <description>In production environments, your API may have to access a message broker that&amp;rsquo;s protected by some auth mechanisms. Examples of these are:
 User &amp;amp; password Certificates API keys OAuth 2  If you&amp;rsquo;re using AsyncAPI to define an API that connects to a message broker, you&amp;rsquo;ll most probably make use of user/password or certificates. Traditionally, message brokers are infrastructure pieces that serve an internal purpose and they&amp;rsquo;re not exposed to the public.</description>

      <description>Hey folks! After some time thinking about it, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided it&amp;rsquo;s time to define some important dates for AsyncAPI 2.0.0. So here we go!
End of review period (July 1, 2019) After some time, many people have reviewed the specification and they&amp;rsquo;ve identified some issues that need to be addressed before we launch the version 2.0.0. Actually, this process will never finish but we have to decide on a date to stop reviewing and move forward.</description>

      <title>AsyncAPI and CloudEvents</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been receiving the same question for a long time now: Should I use CloudEvents or AsyncAPI? — And my response has always been the same: it depends!
There is the belief by many people that AsyncAPI and CloudEvents are competing for the same thing. This can&amp;rsquo;t be less true, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to explain you why. Read on!
What is CloudEvents? From cloudevents.io:
 Enter CloudEvents, a specification for describing event data in a common way.</description>

      <title>Replicating the Success of REST in Event-Driven Architecture</title>

      <description>This post is a collaboration between Fran Méndez of AsyncAPI and Solace’s Jonathan Schabowsky. It was originally published at Solace’s blog.
Jonathan explained in his last blog post how the loose coupling of applications associated with event-driven architecture and publish/subscribe messaging is both a strength and a weakness. As part of that, he touched on the fact that request/reply interactions using RESTful APIs are still the dominant application integration paradigm, even in hybrid cloud, machine learning and IoT use cases that benefit from event-driven interactions.</description>

      <description>Alas güenas tardis! This week we&amp;rsquo;ve made significant progress on the documentation and the parser. The goal is to make AsyncAPI 2.0.0 easy and quick to learn at the same time we provide you the necessary tools to start playing with it. Check out the progress so far:
The parser  Compile for all platforms: One of the hardest things to solve, before we continue moving forward, was the compilation process.</description>

      <description>Kaixo lagunak! This week we continued working on the parser as it’s a top priority for us. We made significant progress and plan to release a simple but functional version soon.
Building the parser  We’ve added support for AsyncAPI 1.x/OpenAPI schemas. This is the first step before we dive into Avro and Protobuf support. Updated the Node.js to automatically test itself on Linux, Mac, and Windows. We’re still struggling to debug some failures on Windows so we encourage people who work on this operating system to join and help us test.</description>

      <description>Hallo meine Freunde! This week we’ve done great progress on tooling and documentation. It will be our main focus for the next month. In the meantime, check out what we did last week. Read on!
Improvements on documentation  Check out version 2.0.0-rc1 of the specification in our website: https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0-rc1/. Added a “Hello world” article to our getting started guide: https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi.github.io/pull/3. Added a “Servers” article to our getting started guide, explaining how the “servers” section of AsyncAPI works: https://github.</description>

      <description>A recurring question that I get very often is: “how do I organize my AsyncAPI documents?”. Also, the related one: “I have two services, a publisher and a consumer, should I define both in the same AsyncAPI document?”.
Let’s break down some best practices and tips to avoid ending up in a hell of unmanageable documents.
Organizing Microservices  I’m using the term microservices here because it’s the most common type of distributed architecture that you can find nowadays.</description>
