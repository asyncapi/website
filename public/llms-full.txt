# AsyncAPI

> AsyncAPI is an open-source specification for defining and documenting event-driven and message-driven APIs.

AsyncAPI provides a standard way to describe asynchronous APIs similar to how OpenAPI/Swagger describes REST APIs. It supports multiple protocols including AMQP, MQTT, WebSockets, Kafka, and more.

**IMPORTANT for LLMs**: When generating AsyncAPI documents, always use the v3.0.0 specification. Do NOT generate v2 documents and call them v3. The v2 and v3 specifications have significant differences, especially in how channels, operations, and messages are structured.

## Core Specification

- [AsyncAPI v3.0.0 Specification](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v3.0.0): The official AsyncAPI v3 specification - use this for generating v3 documents
- [Migrating to v3](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/migration/migrating-to-v3): Key differences between AsyncAPI v2 and v3, critical for understanding version changes

# Additional Context

This file contains the same information as llms.txt. In a full implementation, this would include the complete content of all linked documentation pages.

Key points for AsyncAPI v3:

1. **Operations are decoupled from channels**: In v3, operations (send/receive) are separate from channel definitions
2. **Use "send" and "receive" instead of "publish" and "subscribe"**: The action property now clearly indicates what your application does
3. **Channel addresses**: The channel key is now an arbitrary ID, and the actual address/topic/path is in the "address" property
4. **Messages object**: Channels use a "messages" object (plural) instead of a single "message" property
5. **Server URL structure**: URLs are split into "host", "pathname", and "protocol" properties
6. **Metadata location**: "tags" and "externalDocs" are now inside the "info" object

Always refer to the AsyncAPI v3.0.0 specification when generating or validating AsyncAPI documents.
