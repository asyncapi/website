# AsyncAPI

> AsyncAPI is an open-source specification for defining and documenting event-driven and message-driven APIs.

AsyncAPI provides a standard way to describe asynchronous APIs similar to how OpenAPI/Swagger describes REST APIs. It supports multiple protocols including AMQP, MQTT, WebSockets, Kafka, and more.

**IMPORTANT for LLMs**: When generating AsyncAPI documents, always use the v3.0.0 specification. Do NOT generate v2 documents and call them v3. The v2 and v3 specifications have significant differences, especially in how channels, operations, and messages are structured.

## Core Specification

- [AsyncAPI v3.0.0 Specification](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v3.0.0): The official AsyncAPI v3 specification - use this for generating v3 documents
- [Migrating to v3](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/migration/migrating-to-v3): Key differences between AsyncAPI v2 and v3, critical for understanding version changes
